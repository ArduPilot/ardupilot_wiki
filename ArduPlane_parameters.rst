Complete Parameter List
=======================

This is a complete list of the parameters which can be set \(e\.g\. via the MAVLink protocol\) to control vehicle behaviour\. They are stored in persistent storage on the vehicle\.

This list is automatically generated from the latest ardupilot source code\, and so may contain parameters which are not yet in the stable released versions of the code\.




.. _parameters_ArduPlane:

ArduPlane Parameters
--------------------


.. _FORMAT_VERSION:

FORMAT\_VERSION: Eeprom format version number
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| *Note: This parameter is for advanced users*

This value is incremented when changes are made to the eeprom format


.. _AUTOTUNE_LEVEL:

AUTOTUNE\_LEVEL: Autotune level
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Level of aggressiveness of pitch and roll PID gains\. Lower values result in a \'softer\' tune\. Level 6 recommended for most planes\. A value of 0 means to keep the current values of RMAX and TCONST for the controllers\, tuning only the PID values

.. _AUTOTUNE_OPTIONS:

AUTOTUNE\_OPTIONS: Autotune options bitmask
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| *Note: This parameter is for advanced users*

Fixed Wing Autotune specific options\. Useful on QuadPlanes with higher INS\_GYRO\_FILTER settings to prevent these filter values from being set too aggressively during Fixed Wing Autotune\.

.. _KFF_RDDRMIX:

KFF\_RDDRMIX: Rudder Mix
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Amount of rudder to add during aileron movement\. Increase if nose initially yaws away from roll\. Reduces adverse yaw\.


+-----------+--------+
| Increment | Range  |
+===========+========+
| 0.01      | 0 to 1 |
+-----------+--------+




.. _KFF_THR2PTCH:

KFF\_THR2PTCH: Throttle to Pitch Mix
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| *Note: This parameter is for advanced users*

Pitch up to add in proportion to throttle\. 100\% throttle will add this number of degrees to the pitch target\.


+-----------+---------+
| Increment | Range   |
+===========+=========+
| 0.01      | -5 to 5 |
+-----------+---------+




.. _STAB_PITCH_DOWN:

STAB\_PITCH\_DOWN: Low throttle pitch down trim
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| *Note: This parameter is for advanced users*

Degrees of down pitch added when throttle is below TRIM\_THROTTLE in FBWA and AUTOTUNE modes\. Scales linearly so full value is added when THR\_MIN is reached\. Helps to keep airspeed higher in glides or landing approaches and prevents accidental stalls\. 2 degrees recommended for most planes\.


+-----------+---------+---------+
| Increment | Range   | Units   |
+===========+=========+=========+
| 0.1       | 0 to 15 | degrees |
+-----------+---------+---------+




.. _ALT_SLOPE_MIN:

ALT\_SLOPE\_MIN: Altitude slope minimum
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| *Note: This parameter is for advanced users*

This controls the minimum altitude change for a waypoint before an altitude slope will be used instead of an immediate altitude change\. The default value is 15 meters\, which helps to smooth out waypoint missions where small altitude changes happen near waypoints\. If you don\'t want altitude slopes to be used in missions then you can set this to zero\, which will disable altitude slope calculations\. Otherwise you can set it to a minimum number of meters of altitude error to the destination waypoint before an altitude slope will be used to change altitude\.


+-----------+-----------+--------+
| Increment | Range     | Units  |
+===========+===========+========+
| 1         | 0 to 1000 | meters |
+-----------+-----------+--------+




.. _ALT_SLOPE_MAXHGT:

ALT\_SLOPE\_MAXHGT: Altitude slope maximum height
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| *Note: This parameter is for advanced users*

This controls the height above the altitude slope the plane may be before rebuilding it\. This is useful for smoothing out an auto\-takeoff\.


+-----------+----------+--------+
| Increment | Range    | Units  |
+===========+==========+========+
| 1         | 0 to 100 | meters |
+-----------+----------+--------+




.. _STICK_MIXING:

STICK\_MIXING: Stick Mixing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| *Note: This parameter is for advanced users*

When enabled\, this adds user stick input to the control surfaces in auto modes\, allowing the user to have some degree of flight control without changing modes\. There are 3 types of stick mixing available\. If you set STICK\_MIXING to 1 or 4 then it will use \"fly by wire\" mixing\. 4 will provide roll and yaw control\, while 1 also provides FBW\-A style pitch control\. If you set STICK\_MIXING to 3 then it will apply to the yaw while in quadplane modes only\, such as while doing an automatic VTOL takeoff or landing\. WARNING\: FBW\-A pitch control does not offer flight envelope protections\. Prolonged pitch inputs in mode 1 can result in a stall or overspeed condition\, and should be avoided\.

+----------------------------------+




.. _TKOFF_THR_MINSPD:

TKOFF\_THR\_MINSPD: Takeoff throttle min speed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Minimum GPS ground speed in m\/s used by the speed check that un\-suppresses throttle in auto\-takeoff\. This can be be used for catapult launches where you want the motor to engage only after the plane leaves the catapult\, but it is preferable to use the TKOFF\_THR\_MINACC and TKOFF\_THR\_DELAY parameters for catapult launches due to the errors associated with GPS measurements\. For hand launches with a pusher prop it is strongly advised that this parameter be set to a value no less than 4 m\/s to provide additional protection against premature motor start\. Note that the GPS velocity will lag the real velocity by about 0\.5 seconds\. The ground speed check is delayed by the TKOFF\_THR\_DELAY parameter\.


+-----------+---------+-------------------+
| Increment | Range   | Units             |
+===========+=========+===================+
| 0.1       | 0 to 30 | meters per second |
+-----------+---------+-------------------+




.. _TKOFF_THR_MINACC:

TKOFF\_THR\_MINACC: Takeoff throttle min acceleration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Minimum forward acceleration in m\/s\/s before arming the ground speed check in auto\-takeoff\. This is meant to be used for hand launches\. Setting this value to 0 disables the acceleration test which means the ground speed check will always be armed which could allow GPS velocity jumps to start the engine\. For hand launches and bungee launches this should be set to around 15\. Also see TKOFF\_ACCEL\_CNT parameter for control of full \"shake to arm\"\.


+-----------+---------+--------------------------+
| Increment | Range   | Units                    |
+===========+=========+==========================+
| 0.1       | 0 to 30 | meters per square second |
+-----------+---------+--------------------------+




.. _TKOFF_THR_DELAY:

TKOFF\_THR\_DELAY: Takeoff throttle delay
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


This parameter sets the time delay \(in 1\/10ths of a second\) that the ground speed check is delayed after the forward acceleration check controlled by TKOFF\_THR\_MINACC has passed\. For hand launches with pusher propellers it is essential that this is set to a value of no less than 2 \(0\.2 seconds\) to ensure that the aircraft is safely clear of the throwers arm before the motor can start\. For bungee launches a larger value can be used \(such as 30\) to give time for the bungee to release from the aircraft before the motor is started\.


+-----------+----------+-------------+
| Increment | Range    | Units       |
+===========+==========+=============+
| 1         | 0 to 127 | deciseconds |
+-----------+----------+-------------+




.. _TKOFF_THR_MAX_T:

TKOFF\_THR\_MAX\_T: Takeoff throttle maximum time
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


This sets the time that maximum throttle will be forced during a fixed wing takeoff\.


+-----------+---------+---------+
| Increment | Range   | Units   |
+===========+=========+=========+
| 0.5       | 0 to 10 | seconds |
+-----------+---------+---------+




.. _TKOFF_THR_MIN:

TKOFF\_THR\_MIN: Takeoff minimum throttle
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


The minimum throttle to use in takeoffs in AUTO and TAKEOFF flight modes\, when TKOFF\_OPTIONS bit 0 is set\. Also\, the minimum throttle to use in a quadpane forward transition\. This can be useful to ensure faster takeoffs or transitions on aircraft where the normal throttle control leads to a slow takeoff or transition\. It is used when it is larger than THR\_MIN\, otherwise THR\_MIN is used instead\.


+-----------+----------+---------+
| Increment | Range    | Units   |
+===========+==========+=========+
| 1         | 0 to 100 | percent |
+-----------+----------+---------+




.. _TKOFF_THR_IDLE:

TKOFF\_THR\_IDLE: Takeoff idle throttle
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


The idle throttle to hold after arming and before a takeoff\. Applicable in TAKEOFF and AUTO modes\.


+-----------+----------+---------+
| Increment | Range    | Units   |
+===========+==========+=========+
| 1         | 0 to 100 | percent |
+-----------+----------+---------+




.. _TKOFF_OPTIONS:

TKOFF\_OPTIONS: Takeoff options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| *Note: This parameter is for advanced users*

This selects the mode of the takeoff in AUTO and TAKEOFF flight modes\.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+




.. _TKOFF_TDRAG_ELEV:

TKOFF\_TDRAG\_ELEV: Takeoff tail dragger elevator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


This parameter sets the amount of elevator to apply during the initial stage of a takeoff\. It is used to hold the tail wheel of a taildragger on the ground during the initial takeoff stage to give maximum steering\. This option should be combined with the TKOFF\_TDRAG\_SPD1 option and the GROUND\_STEER\_ALT option along with tuning of the ground steering controller\. A value of zero means to bypass the initial \"tail hold\" stage of takeoff\. Set to zero for hand and catapult launch\. For tail\-draggers you should normally set this to 100\, meaning full up elevator during the initial stage of takeoff\. For most tricycle undercarriage aircraft a value of zero will work well\, but for some tricycle aircraft a small negative value \(say around \-20 to \-30\) will apply down elevator which will hold the nose wheel firmly on the ground during initial acceleration\. Only use a negative value if you find that the nosewheel doesn\'t grip well during takeoff\. Too much down elevator on a tricycle undercarriage may cause instability in steering as the plane pivots around the nosewheel\. Add down elevator 10 percent at a time\.


+-----------+-------------+---------+
| Increment | Range       | Units   |
+===========+=============+=========+
| 1         | -100 to 100 | percent |
+-----------+-------------+---------+




.. _TKOFF_TDRAG_SPD1:

TKOFF\_TDRAG\_SPD1: Takeoff tail dragger speed1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


This parameter sets the airspeed at which to stop holding the tail down and transition to rudder control of steering on the ground\. When TKOFF\_TDRAG\_SPD1 is reached the pitch of the aircraft will be held level until TKOFF\_ROTATE\_SPD is reached\, at which point the takeoff pitch specified in the mission will be used to \"rotate\" the pitch for takeoff climb\. Set TKOFF\_TDRAG\_SPD1 to zero to go straight to rotation\. This should be set to zero for hand launch and catapult launch\. It should also be set to zero for tricycle undercarriages unless you are using the method above to gently hold the nose wheel down\. For tail dragger aircraft it should be set just below the stall speed\.


+-----------+---------+-------------------+
| Increment | Range   | Units             |
+===========+=========+===================+
| 0.1       | 0 to 30 | meters per second |
+-----------+---------+-------------------+




.. _TKOFF_ROTATE_SPD:

TKOFF\_ROTATE\_SPD: Takeoff rotate speed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


This parameter sets the airspeed at which the aircraft will \"rotate\"\, setting climb pitch specified in the mission\. If TKOFF\_ROTATE\_SPD is zero then the climb pitch will be used as soon as takeoff is started\. For hand launch and catapult launches a TKOFF\_ROTATE\_SPD of zero should be set\. For all ground launches TKOFF\_ROTATE\_SPD should be set above the stall speed\, usually by about 10 to 30 percent\. During the run\, use TKOFF\_GND\_PITCH to keep the aircraft on the runway while below this airspeed\.


+-----------+---------+-------------------+
| Increment | Range   | Units             |
+===========+=========+===================+
| 0.1       | 0 to 30 | meters per second |
+-----------+---------+-------------------+




.. _TKOFF_THR_SLEW:

TKOFF\_THR\_SLEW: Takeoff throttle slew rate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


This parameter sets the slew rate for the throttle during auto takeoff\. When this is zero the THR\_SLEWRATE parameter is used during takeoff\. For rolling takeoffs it can be a good idea to set a lower slewrate for takeoff to give a slower acceleration which can improve ground steering control\. The value is a percentage throttle change per second\, so a value of 20 means to advance the throttle over 5 seconds on takeoff\. Values below 20 are not recommended as they may cause the plane to try to climb out with too little throttle\. A value of \-1 means no limit on slew rate in takeoff\.


+-----------+-----------+--------------------+
| Increment | Range     | Units              |
+===========+===========+====================+
| 1         | -1 to 127 | percent per second |
+-----------+-----------+--------------------+




.. _TKOFF_PLIM_SEC:

TKOFF\_PLIM\_SEC: Takeoff pitch limit reduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| *Note: This parameter is for advanced users*

This parameter reduces the pitch minimum limit of an auto\-takeoff just a few seconds before it reaches the target altitude\. This reduces overshoot by allowing the flight controller to start leveling off a few seconds before reaching the target height\. When set to zero\, the mission pitch min is enforced all the way to and through the target altitude\, otherwise the pitch min slowly reduces to zero in the final segment\. This is the pitch\_min\, not the demand\. The flight controller should still be commanding to gain altitude to finish the takeoff but with this param it is not forcing it higher than it wants to be\.


+-----------+---------+---------+
| Increment | Range   | Units   |
+===========+=========+=========+
| 0.5       | 0 to 10 | seconds |
+-----------+---------+---------+




.. _TKOFF_FLAP_PCNT:

TKOFF\_FLAP\_PCNT: Takeoff flap percentage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| *Note: This parameter is for advanced users*

The amount of flaps \(as a percentage\) to apply in automatic takeoff


+-----------+----------+---------+
| Increment | Range    | Units   |
+===========+==========+=========+
| 1         | 0 to 100 | percent |
+-----------+----------+---------+




.. _LEVEL_ROLL_LIMIT:

LEVEL\_ROLL\_LIMIT: Level flight roll limit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


This controls the maximum bank angle in degrees during flight modes where level flight is desired\, such as in the final stages of landing\, and during auto takeoff\. This should be a small angle \(such as 5 degrees\) to prevent a wing hitting the runway during takeoff or landing\. Setting this to zero will completely disable heading hold on auto takeoff while below 5 meters and during the flare portion of a final landing approach\.


+-----------+---------+---------+
| Increment | Range   | Units   |
+===========+=========+=========+
| 1         | 0 to 45 | degrees |
+-----------+---------+---------+




.. _USE_REV_THRUST:

USE\_REV\_THRUST: Bitmask for when to allow negative reverse thrust
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| *Note: This parameter is for advanced users*

This controls when to use reverse thrust\. If set to a non\-zero value then the bits correspond to flight stages where reverse thrust may be used\. The most commonly used value for USE\_REV\_THRUST is 2\, which means AUTO\_LAND only\. That enables reverse thrust in the landing stage of AUTO mode\. Another common choice is 1\, which means to use reverse thrust in all auto flight stages\. Reverse thrust is always used in MANUAL mode if enabled with THR\_MIN \< 0\. In non\-autothrottle controlled modes\, if reverse thrust is not used\, then THR\_MIN is effectively set to 0 for that mode\.

.. _ALT_OFFSET:

ALT\_OFFSET: Altitude offset
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| *Note: This parameter is for advanced users*

This is added to the target altitude in automatic flight\. It can be used to add a global altitude offset to a mission


+-----------+-----------------+--------+
| Increment | Range           | Units  |

| 1         | -32767 to 32767 | meters |
+-----------+-----------------+--------+




.. _WP_RADIUS:

WP\_RADIUS: Waypoint Radius
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Defines the maximum distance from a waypoint that when crossed indicates the waypoint may be complete\. To avoid the aircraft looping around the waypoint in case it misses by more than the WP\_RADIUS an additional check is made to see if the aircraft has crossed a \"finish line\" passing through the waypoint and perpendicular to the flight path from the previous waypoint\. If that finish line is crossed then the waypoint is considered complete\. Note that the navigation controller may decide to turn later than WP\_RADIUS before a waypoint\, based on how sharp the turn is and the speed of the aircraft\. It is safe to set WP\_RADIUS much larger than the usual turn radius of your aircraft and the navigation controller will work out when to turn\. If you set WP\_RADIUS too small then you will tend to overshoot the turns\.

| 1         | 1 to 32767 | meters |
+-----------+------------+--------+




.. _WP_MAX_RADIUS:

WP\_MAX\_RADIUS: Waypoint Maximum Radius
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Sets the maximum distance to a waypoint for the waypoint to be considered complete\. This overrides the \"cross the finish line\" logic that is normally used to consider a waypoint complete\. For normal AUTO behaviour this parameter should be set to zero\. Using a non\-zero value is only recommended when it is critical that the aircraft does approach within the given radius\, and should loop around until it has done so\. This can cause the aircraft to loop forever if its turn radius is greater than the maximum radius set\.


+-----------+------------+--------+

| 1         | 0 to 32767 | meters |
+-----------+------------+--------+




.. _WP_LOITER_RAD:

WP\_LOITER\_RAD: Waypoint Loiter Radius
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Defines the distance from the waypoint center\, the plane will maintain during a loiter\. If you set this value to a negative number then the default loiter direction will be counter\-clockwise instead of clockwise\. If this value is too close to zero\, the achieved loiter radius will be determined by ROLL\_LIMIT\_DEG\.


+-----------+-----------------+--------+
| Increment | Range           | Units  |
+===========+=================+========+
| 1         | -32767 to 32767 | meters |
+-----------+-----------------+--------+




.. _RTL_RADIUS:

RTL\_RADIUS: RTL loiter radius
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Defines the radius of the loiter circle when in RTL mode\. If this is zero then WP\_LOITER\_RAD is used\. If the radius is negative then a counter\-clockwise is used\. If positive then a clockwise loiter is used\. For quadplanes with Q\_RTL\_MODE set to 1 \(Enabled\)\, this value is used to set the minimum radius at which the plane will transition from fixed\-wing to VTOL mode for landing\.


+-----------+-----------------+--------+

.. _STALL_PREVENTION:

STALL\_PREVENTION: Enable stall prevention
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Enables roll limits at low airspeed in roll limiting flight modes\. Roll limits based on aerodynamic load factor in turns and scale on AIRSPEED\_MIN that must be set correctly\. Without airspeed sensor\, uses synthetic airspeed from wind speed estimate that may both be inaccurate\.

.. _AIRSPEED_CRUISE:

AIRSPEED\_CRUISE: Target cruise airspeed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Target cruise airspeed in m\/s in automatic throttle modes\. Value is as an indicated \(calibrated\/apparent\) airspeed\.

.. _AIRSPEED_MIN:

AIRSPEED\_MIN: Minimum Airspeed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Minimum airspeed demanded in automatic throttle modes\. Should be set to 20\% higher than level flight stall speed\.


+-----------+----------+-------------------+
| Increment | Range    | Units             |
+===========+==========+===================+
| 1         | 5 to 100 | meters per second |
+-----------+----------+-------------------+




.. _AIRSPEED_MAX:

AIRSPEED\_MAX: Maximum Airspeed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Maximum airspeed demanded in automatic throttle modes\. Should be set slightly less than level flight speed at THR\_MAX and also at least 50\% above AIRSPEED\_MIN to allow for accurate TECS altitude control\.


+-----------+----------+-------------------+
| Increment | Range    | Units             |

| 1         | 5 to 100 | meters per second |
+-----------+----------+-------------------+




.. _AIRSPEED_STALL:

AIRSPEED\_STALL: Stall airspeed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


If stall prevention is enabled this speed is used to calculate the minimum airspeed while banking\. It is also used during landing final as the minimum airspeed that can be demanded by the TECS\, which allows using TECS\_LAND\_ARSPD or LAND\_PF\_ARSPD to achieve landings slower than AIRSPEED\_MIN\. If this is set to 0 then the stall speed is assumed to be the minimum airspeed speed\. Typically set slightly higher then true stall speed\.

.. _FBWB_ELEV_REV:

FBWB\_ELEV\_REV: Fly By Wire elevator reverse
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Reverse sense of elevator in FBWB and CRUISE modes\. When set to 0 up elevator \(pulling back on the stick\) means to raise altitude\. When set to 1\, up elevator means to lower altitude\.

.. _TERRAIN_FOLLOW:

TERRAIN\_FOLLOW: Use terrain following
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


This enables terrain following for CRUISE mode\, FBWB mode\, RTL and for rally points\. To use this option you also need to set TERRAIN\_ENABLE to 1\, which enables terrain data fetching from the GCS\, and you need to have a GCS that supports sending terrain data to the aircraft\. When terrain following is enabled then CRUISE and FBWB mode will hold height above terrain rather than height above home\. In RTL the return to launch altitude will be considered to be a height above the terrain\. Rally point altitudes will be taken as height above the terrain\. This option does not affect mission items\, which have a per\-waypoint flag for whether they are height above home or height above the terrain\. To use terrain following missions you need a ground station which can set the waypoint type to be a terrain height waypoint when creating the mission\.

.. _TERRAIN_LOOKAHD:

TERRAIN\_LOOKAHD: Terrain lookahead
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


This controls how far ahead the terrain following code looks to ensure it stays above upcoming terrain\. A value of zero means no lookahead\, so the controller will track only the terrain directly below the aircraft\. The lookahead will never extend beyond the next waypoint when in AUTO mode\.

.. _FBWB_CLIMB_RATE:

FBWB\_CLIMB\_RATE: Fly By Wire B altitude change rate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


This sets the rate in m\/s at which FBWB and CRUISE modes will change its target altitude for full elevator deflection\. Note that the actual climb rate of the aircraft can be lower than this\, depending on your airspeed and throttle control settings\. If you have this parameter set to the default value of 2\.0\, then holding the elevator at maximum deflection for 10 seconds would change the target altitude by 20 meters\.

.. _TKOFF_THR_MAX:

TKOFF\_THR\_MAX: Maximum Throttle for takeoff
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| *Note: This parameter is for advanced users*

The maximum throttle setting during automatic takeoff\. If this is zero then THR\_MAX is used for takeoff as well\.

.. _THR_SLEWRATE:

THR\_SLEWRATE: Throttle slew rate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Maximum change in throttle percentage per second\. Lower limit  based on 1 microsend of servo increase per loop\. Divide SCHED\_LOOP\_RATE by approximately 10 to determine minimum achievable value\.


+-----------+----------+--------------------+
| Increment | Range    | Units              |

.. _FLAP_SLEWRATE:

FLAP\_SLEWRATE: Flap slew rate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| *Note: This parameter is for advanced users*

maximum percentage change in flap output per second\. A setting of 25 means to not change the flap by more than 25\% of the full flap range in one second\. A value of 0 means no rate limiting\.


+-----------+----------+--------------------+
| Increment | Range    | Units              |

.. _THR_SUPP_MAN:

THR\_SUPP\_MAN: Throttle suppress manual passthru
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| *Note: This parameter is for advanced users*

When throttle is suppressed in auto mode it is normally forced to zero\. If you enable this option\, then while suppressed it will be manual throttle\. This is useful on petrol engines to hold the idle throttle manually while waiting for takeoff

.. _THR_PASS_STAB:

THR\_PASS\_STAB: Throttle passthru in stabilize
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| *Note: This parameter is for advanced users*

If this is set then when in STABILIZE\, FBWA or ACRO modes the throttle is a direct passthru from the transmitter\. This means the THR\_MIN and THR\_MAX settings are not used in these modes\. This is useful for petrol engines where you setup a throttle cut switch that suppresses the throttle below the normal minimum\.

.. _THR_FAILSAFE:

THR\_FAILSAFE: Throttle and RC Failsafe Enable
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


0 disables the failsafe\. 1 enables failsafe on loss of RC input\. This is detected either by throttle values below THR\_FS\_VALUE\, loss of receiver valid pulses\/data\, or by the FS bit in receivers that provide it\, like SBUS\. A programmable failsafe action will occur and RC inputs\, if present\, will be ignored\. A value of 2 means that the RC inputs won\'t be used when RC failsafe is detected by any of the above methods\, but it won\'t trigger an RC failsafe action\.

.. _TRIM_THROTTLE:

TRIM\_THROTTLE: Throttle cruise percentage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Target percentage of throttle to apply for flight in automatic throttle modes and throttle percentage that maintains AIRSPEED\_CRUISE\. Caution\: low battery voltages at the end of flights may require higher throttle to maintain airspeed\.


+-----------+----------+---------+
| Increment | Range    | Units   |

| 1         | 0 to 100 | percent |
+-----------+----------+---------+




.. _THROTTLE_NUDGE:

THROTTLE\_NUDGE: Throttle nudge enable
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


When enabled\, this uses the throttle input in auto\-throttle modes to \'nudge\' the throttle or airspeed to higher or lower values\. When you have an airspeed sensor the nudge affects the target airspeed\, so that throttle inputs above 50\% will increase the target airspeed from AIRSPEED\_CRUISE up to a maximum of AIRSPEED\_MAX\. When no airspeed sensor is enabled the throttle nudge will push up the target throttle for throttle inputs above 50\%\.

.. _FS_SHORT_ACTN:

FS\_SHORT\_ACTN: Short failsafe action
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


The action to take on a short \(FS\_SHORT\_TIMEOUT\) failsafe event\. A short failsafe event can be triggered either by loss of RC control \(see THR\_FS\_VALUE\) or by loss of GCS control \(see FS\_GCS\_ENABL\)\. If in CIRCLE or RTL mode this parameter is ignored\. A short failsafe event in stabilization and manual modes will cause a change to CIRCLE mode if FS\_SHORT\_ACTN is 0 or 1\, a change to FBWA mode with zero throttle if FS\_SHORT\_ACTN is 2\, and a change to FBWB mode if FS\_SHORT\_ACTN is 4\. In all other modes \(AUTO\, GUIDED and LOITER\) a short failsafe event will cause no mode change if FS\_SHORT\_ACTN is set to 0\, will cause a change to CIRCLE mode if set to 1\, will change to FBWA mode with zero throttle if set to 2\, or will change to FBWB if set to 4\. Please see the documentation for FS\_LONG\_ACTN for the behaviour after FS\_LONG\_TIMEOUT seconds of failsafe\. This parameter only applies to failsafes during fixed wing modes\. Quadplane modes will switch to QLAND unless Q\_OPTIONS bit 5\(QRTL\) or 20\(RTL\) are set\.

| 0.5       | 1 to 100 | seconds |
+-----------+----------+---------+




.. _FS_LONG_ACTN:

FS\_LONG\_ACTN: Long failsafe action
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


The action to take on a long \(FS\_LONG\_TIMEOUT seconds\) failsafe event\. If the aircraft was in a stabilization or manual mode when failsafe started and a long failsafe occurs then it will change to RTL mode if FS\_LONG\_ACTN is 0 or 1\, and will change to FBWA if FS\_LONG\_ACTN is set to 2\. If the aircraft was in an auto mode \(such as AUTO or GUIDED\) when the failsafe started then it will continue in the auto mode if FS\_LONG\_ACTN is set to 0\, will change to RTL mode if FS\_LONG\_ACTN is set to 1 and will change to FBWA mode if FS\_LONG\_ACTN is set to 2\. If FS\_LONG\_ACTN is set to 3\, the parachute will be deployed \(make sure the chute is configured and enabled\)\. If FS\_LONG\_ACTN is set to 4 the aircraft will switch to mode AUTO with the current waypoint if it is not already in mode AUTO\, unless it is in the middle of a landing sequence\. If FS\_LONG\_ACTN is set to 5\, will switch to AUTOLAND mode if possible\, otherwise RTL mode\. This parameter only applies to failsafes during fixed wing modes\. Quadplane modes will switch to QLAND unless Q\_OPTIONS bit 5 \(QRTL\) or 20\(RTL\) are set\.

.. _FS_LONG_TIMEOUT:

FS\_LONG\_TIMEOUT: Long failsafe timeout
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


The time in seconds that a failsafe condition has to persist before a long failsafe event will occur\. This defaults to 5 seconds\.


+-----------+----------+---------+
| Increment | Range    | Units   |
+===========+==========+=========+
| 0.5       | 1 to 300 | seconds |
+-----------+----------+---------+




.. _FS_GCS_ENABL:

FS\_GCS\_ENABL: GCS failsafe enable
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Enable ground control station telemetry failsafe\. Failsafe will trigger after FS\_LONG\_TIMEOUT seconds of no MAVLink heartbeat messages\. There are three possible enabled settings\. Setting FS\_GCS\_ENABL to 1 means that GCS failsafe will be triggered when the aircraft has not received a MAVLink HEARTBEAT message\. Note that heartbeat tracking only becomes active after having received the first heartbeat from the MAV\_GCS\_SYSID primary GCS system\. Setting FS\_GCS\_ENABL to 2 means that GCS failsafe will be triggered on either a loss of HEARTBEAT messages\, or a RADIO\_STATUS message from a MAVLink enabled telemetry adio indicating that the primary ground station is not receiving status updates from the aircraft\, which is indicated by the RADIO\_STATUS\.remrssi field being zero \(this may happen if you have a one way link due to asymmetric noise on the ground station and aircraft radios\)\.Setting FS\_GCS\_ENABL to 3 means that GCS failsafe will be triggered by Heartbeat\(like option one\)\, but only in AUTO mode\. WARNING\: Enabling this option opens up the possibility of your plane going into failsafe mode and running the motor on the ground it it loses contact with your ground station\. If this option is enabled on an electric plane then you should enable ARMING\_REQUIRED\.

+-----------+-----------+--------------------+




.. _ACRO_YAW_RATE:

ACRO\_YAW\_RATE: ACRO mode yaw rate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


The maximum yaw rate at full stick deflection in ACRO mode\. If this is zero then rudder is directly controlled by rudder stick input\. This option is only available if you also set YAW\_RATE\_ENABLE to 1\.


+-----------+----------+--------------------+
| Increment | Range    | Units              |
+===========+==========+====================+

.. _ACRO_LOCKING:

ACRO\_LOCKING: ACRO mode attitude locking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|                        |
+------------------------+




.. _GROUND_STEER_ALT:

GROUND\_STEER\_ALT: Ground steer altitude
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Altitude at which to use the ground steering controller on the rudder\. If non\-zero then the STEER2SRV controller will be used to control the rudder for altitudes within this limit of the home altitude\.


+-----------+-------------+--------+
| Increment | Range       | Units  |
+===========+=============+========+
| 0.1       | -100 to 100 | meters |

.. _GROUND_STEER_DPS:

GROUND\_STEER\_DPS: Ground steer rate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| *Note: This parameter is for advanced users*

Ground steering rate in degrees per second for full rudder stick deflection


+-----------+-----------+--------------------+
| Increment | Range     | Units              |
+===========+===========+====================+
| 1         | 10 to 360 | degrees per second |
+-----------+-----------+--------------------+




.. _MIXING_GAIN:

MIXING\_GAIN: Mixing Gain
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


The gain for the Vtail and elevon output mixers\. The default is 0\.5\, which ensures that the mixer doesn\'t saturate\, allowing both input channels to go to extremes while retaining control over the output\. Hardware mixers often have a 1\.0 gain\, which gives more servo throw\, but can saturate\. If you don\'t have enough throw on your servos with VTAIL\_OUTPUT or ELEVON\_OUTPUT enabled then you can raise the gain using MIXING\_GAIN\. The mixer allows outputs in the range 900 to 2100 microseconds\.


+------------+
| Range      |
+============+
| 0.5 to 1.2 |
+------------+




.. _RUDDER_ONLY:

RUDDER\_ONLY: Rudder only aircraft
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Enable rudder only mode\. The rudder will control attitude in attitude controlled modes \(such as FBWA\)\. You should setup your transmitter to send roll stick inputs to the RCMAP\_YAW channel \(normally channel 4\)\. The rudder servo should be attached to the RCMAP\_YAW channel as well\. Note that automatic ground steering will be disabled for rudder only aircraft\. You should also set KFF\_RDDRMIX to 1\.0\. You will also need to setup the YAW2SRV\_DAMP yaw damping appropriately for your aircraft\. A value of 0\.5 for YAW2SRV\_DAMP is a good starting point\.


+----------------------+
| Values               |
+======================+
| +-------+----------+ |
| | Value | Meaning  | |
| +=======+==========+ |
| | 0     | Disabled | |
| +-------+----------+ |
| | 1     | Enabled  | |
| +-------+----------+ |
|                      |
+----------------------+




.. _MIXING_OFFSET:

MIXING\_OFFSET: Mixing Offset
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


The offset for the Vtail and elevon output mixers\, as a percentage\. This can be used in combination with MIXING\_GAIN to configure how the control surfaces respond to input\. The response to aileron or elevator input can be increased by setting this parameter to a positive or negative value\. A common usage is to enter a positive value to increase the aileron response of the elevons of a flying wing\. The default value of zero will leave the aileron\-input response equal to the elevator\-input response\.


+---------------+-------------+
| Range         | Units       |
+===============+=============+
| -1000 to 1000 | decipercent |
+---------------+-------------+




.. _DSPOILR_RUD_RATE:

DSPOILR\_RUD\_RATE: Differential spoilers rudder rate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Sets the amount of deflection that the rudder output will apply to the differential spoilers\, as a percentage\. The default value of 100 results in full rudder applying full deflection\. A value of 0 will result in the differential spoilers exactly following the elevons \(no rudder effect\)\.


+-------------+---------+
| Range       | Units   |
+=============+=========+
| -100 to 100 | percent |
+-------------+---------+




.. _LOG_BITMASK:

LOG\_BITMASK: Log bitmask
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| *Note: This parameter is for advanced users*

Bitmap of what on\-board log types to enable\. This value is made up of the sum of each of the log types you want to be saved\. It is usually best just to enable all basic log types by setting this to 65535\.

.. _OVERRIDE_CHAN:

OVERRIDE\_CHAN: IO override channel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| *Note: This parameter is for advanced users*

If set to a non\-zero value then this is an RC input channel number to use for giving IO manual control in case the main FMU microcontroller on a board with a IO co\-processor fails\. When this RC input channel goes above 1750 the FMU microcontroller will no longer be involved in controlling the servos and instead the IO microcontroller will directly control the servos\. Note that IO manual control will be automatically activated if the FMU crashes for any reason\. This parameter allows you to test for correct manual behaviour without actually crashing the FMU\. This parameter is can be set to a non\-zero value either for ground testing purposes or for giving the effect of an external override control board\. Note that you may set OVERRIDE\_CHAN to the same channel as FLTMODE\_CH to get IO based override when in flight mode 6\. Note that when override is triggered due to a FMU crash the 6 auxiliary output channels on the FMU will no longer be updated\, so all the flight controls you need must be assigned to the first 8 channels on boards with an IOMCU\.

The closest landing sequence will be chosen to the current location For a value of 1 a rally point will be used instead of HOME if in range \(see rally point documentation\)\.If this is set to 0 and there is a DO\_LAND\_START or DO\_RETURN\_PATH\_START mission item then you will get an arming check failure\. You can set to a value of 3 to avoid the arming check failure and use the DO\_LAND\_START for go\-around \(see wiki for aborting autolandings\) without it changing RTL behaviour\.

.. _CRASH_ACC_THRESH:

CRASH\_ACC\_THRESH: Crash Deceleration Threshold
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| *Note: This parameter is for advanced users*

X\-Axis deceleration threshold to notify the crash detector that there was a possible impact which helps disarm the motor quickly after a crash\. This value should be much higher than normal negative x\-axis forces during normal flight\, check flight log files to determine the average IMU\.x values for your aircraft and motor type\. Higher value means less sensitive \(triggers on higher impact\)\. For electric planes that don\'t vibrate much during fight a value of 25 is good \(that\'s about 2\.5G\)\. For petrol\/nitro planes you\'ll want a higher value\. Set to 0 to disable the collision detector\.

.. _AFS_AMSL_LIMIT:

AFS\_AMSL\_LIMIT: AMSL limit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| *Note: This parameter is for advanced users*

This sets the AMSL \(above mean sea level\) altitude limit\. If the pressure altitude determined by QNH exceeds this limit then flight termination will be forced\.

.. _ARMING_CHECK:

ARMING\_CHECK: Arm Checks to Perform \(bitmask\)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Checks prior to arming motor\. This is a bitmask of checks that will be performed before allowing arming\. For most users it is recommended to leave this at the default of 1 \(all checks enabled\)\. You can select whatever checks you prefer by adding together the values of each check type to set this parameter\. For example\, to only allow arming when you have GPS lock and no RC failsafe you would set ARMING\_CHECK to 72\.

.. _ARMING_CRSDP_IGN:

ARMING\_CRSDP\_IGN: Disable CrashDump Arming check
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| *Note: This parameter is for advanced users*

Must have value \"1\" if crashdump data is present on the system\, or a prearm failure will be raised\.  Do not set this parameter unless the risks of doing so are fully understood\.  The presence of a crash dump means that the firmware currently installed has suffered a critical software failure which resulted in the autopilot immediately rebooting\.  The crashdump file gives diagnostic information which can help in finding the issue\, please contact the ArduPIlot support team\.  If this crashdump data is present\, the vehicle is likely unsafe to fly\.  Check the ArduPilot documentation for more details\.

.. _ARSPD_TUBE_ORDER:

ARSPD\_TUBE\_ORDER: Control pitot tube order
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| *Note: This parameter is for advanced users*

This parameter allows you to control whether the order in which the tubes are attached to your pitot tube matters\. If you set this to 0 then the first \(often the top\) connector on the sensor needs to be the stagnation pressure \(the pressure at the tip of the pitot tube\)\. If set to 1 then the second \(often the bottom\) connector needs to be the stagnation pressure\. If set to 2 \(the default\) then the airspeed driver will accept either order\. The reason you may wish to specify the order is it will allow your airspeed sensor to detect if the aircraft is receiving excessive pressure on the static port compared to the stagnation port such as during a stall\, which would otherwise be seen as a positive airspeed\.


+-------------------------+
| Values                  |

Larger values will make the re\-enabling of the airspeed sensor faster\, but increase the likelihood of re\-enabling a degraded sensor\. The value can be tuned by using the ARSP\.TR log message by setting ARSPD\_WIND\_GATE to a value that is higher than the value for ARSP\.TR observed with a healthy airspeed sensor\. Occasional transients in ARSP\.TR above the value set by ARSPD\_WIND\_GATE can be tolerated provided they are less than 5 seconds in duration and less than 10\% duty cycle\.

Enables automatic adjustment of airspeed ratio during a calibration flight based on estimation of ground speed and true airspeed\. New ratio saved every 2 minutes if change is \> 5\%\. Should not be left enabled\.


.. _ARSPD2_TUBE_ORDR:

ARSPD2\_TUBE\_ORDR: Control pitot tube order
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| *Note: This parameter is for advanced users*

This parameter allows you to control whether the order in which the tubes are attached to your pitot tube matters\. If you set this to 0 then the first \(often the top\) connector on the sensor needs to be the stagnation pressure \(the pressure at the tip of the pitot tube\)\. If set to 1 then the second \(often the bottom\) connector needs to be the stagnation pressure\. If set to 2 \(the default\) then the airspeed driver will accept either order\. The reason you may wish to specify the order is it will allow your airspeed sensor to detect if the aircraft is receiving excessive pressure on the static port compared to the stagnation port such as during a stall\, which would otherwise be seen as a positive airspeed\.

If the baro height estimate rises above truth height during descending flight \(or forward flight with a high backwards lean angle\, eg braking manoeuvre\)\, then this should be a negative number\. Multirotors can use this feature only if using EKF3 and if the EK3\_DRAG\_BCOEF\_X and EK3\_DRAG\_BCOEF\_Y parameters have been tuned\.

.. _COMPASS_ORIENT3:

COMPASS\_ORIENT3: Compass3 orientation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| *Note: This parameter is for advanced users*

The orientation of a third external compass relative to the vehicle frame\. This value will be ignored unless this compass is set as an external compass\. When set correctly in the northern hemisphere\, pointing the nose and right side down should increase the MagX and MagY values respectively\. Rolling the vehicle upside down should decrease the MagZ value\. For southern hemisphere\, switch increase and decrease\. NOTE\: For internal compasses\, AHRS\_ORIENT is used\. The label for each option is specified in the order of rotations for that orientation\. Firmware versions 4\.2 and prior can use a CUSTOM \(100\) rotation to set the COMPASS\_CUS\_ROLL\/PIT\/YAW angles for Compass orientation\. Later versions provide two general custom rotations which can be used\, Custom 1 and Custom 2\, with CUST\_1\_ROLL\/PIT\/YAW or CUST\_2\_ROLL\/PIT\/YAW angles\.

| *Note: This parameter is for advanced users*

This determines when the filter will use the 3\-axis magnetometer fusion model that estimates both earth and body fixed magnetic field states\, when it will use a simpler magnetic heading fusion model that does not use magnetic field states and when it will use an alternative method of yaw determination to the magnetometer\. The 3\-axis magnetometer fusion is only suitable for use when the external magnetic field environment is stable\.

EK2\_MAG\_CAL \= 2 uses heading fusion at all times\, is recommended if the external magnetic field is varying and is the default for rovers\. EK2\_MAG\_CAL \= 3 uses heading fusion on the ground and 3\-axis fusion after the first in\-air field and yaw reset has completed\, and is the default for copters\. EK2\_MAG\_CAL \= 4 uses 3\-axis fusion at all times\. NOTE\: The fusion mode can be forced to 2 for specific EKF cores using the EK2\_MAG\_MASK parameter\. NOTE\: limited operation without a magnetometer or any other yaw sensor is possible by setting all COMPASS\_USE\, COMPASS\_USE2\, COMPASS\_USE3\, etc parameters to 0 with COMPASS\_ENABLE set to 1\. If this is done\, the EK2\_GSF\_RUN and EK2\_GSF\_USE masks must be set to the same as EK2\_IMU\_MASK\.

| *Note: This parameter is for advanced users*
| *Note: Reboot required after change*

When a height sensor other than GPS is used as the primary height source by the EKF\, the position of the zero height datum is defined by that sensor and its frame of reference\. If a GPS height measurement is also available\, then the height of the WGS\-84 height datum used by the EKF can be corrected so that the height returned by the getLLH\(\) function is compensated for primary height sensor drift and change in datum over time\. The first two bit positions control when the height datum will be corrected\. Correction is performed using a Bayes filter and only operates when GPS quality permits\. The third bit position controls where the corrections to the GPS reference datum are applied\. Corrections can be applied to the local vertical position or to the reported EKF origin height \(default\)\.

EK3\_VEL\_I\_GATE: GPS velocity innovation gate size
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| *Note: This parameter is for advanced users*

This sets the percentage number of standard deviations applied to the GPS velocity measurement innovation consistency check\. Decreasing it makes it more likely that good measurements will be rejected\. Increasing it makes it more likely that bad measurements will be accepted\. If EK3\_GLITCH\_RAD set to 0 the velocity innovations will be clipped instead of rejected if they exceed the gate size and a smaller value of EK3\_VEL\_I\_GATE not exceeding 300 is recommended to limit the effect of GPS transient errors\.

.. _EK3_GLITCH_RAD:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| *Note: This parameter is for advanced users*

This controls the maximum radial uncertainty in position between the value predicted by the filter and the value measured by the GPS before the filter position and velocity states are reset to the GPS\. Making this value larger allows the filter to ignore larger GPS glitches but also means that non\-GPS errors such as IMU and compass can create a larger error in position before the filter is forced back to the GPS position\. If EK3\_GLITCH\_RAD set to 0 the GPS innovations will be clipped instead of rejected if they exceed the gate size set by EK3\_VEL\_I\_GATE and EK3\_POS\_I\_GATE which can be useful if poor quality sensor data is causing GPS rejection and loss of navigation but does make the EKF more susceptible to GPS glitches\. If setting EK3\_GLITCH\_RAD to 0 it is recommended to reduce EK3\_VEL\_I\_GATE and EK3\_POS\_I\_GATE to 300\.

A larger value for EK3\_ALT\_M\_NSE may be required when operating with EK3\_SRCx\_POSZ \= 0\. This parameter also sets the noise for the \'synthetic\' zero height measurement that is used when EK3\_SRCx\_POSZ \= 0\.

Increasing it makes it more likely that bad measurements will be accepted\.  If EK3\_GLITCH\_RAD set to 0 the vertical position innovations will be clipped instead of rejected if they exceed the gate size and a smaller value of EK3\_HGT\_I\_GATE not exceeding 300 is recommended to limit the effect of height sensor transient errors\.

.. _EK3_MAG_CAL:

EK3\_MAG\_CAL: Magnetometer default fusion mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| *Note: This parameter is for advanced users*
| *Note: Reboot required after change*

This determines when the filter will use the 3\-axis magnetometer fusion model that estimates both earth and body fixed magnetic field states and when it will use a simpler magnetic heading fusion model that does not use magnetic field states\. The 3\-axis magnetometer fusion is only suitable for use when the external magnetic field environment is stable\. EK3\_MAG\_CAL \= 0 uses heading fusion on ground\, 3\-axis fusion in\-flight\, and is the default setting for Plane users\. EK3\_MAG\_CAL \= 1 uses 3\-axis fusion only when manoeuvring\. EK3\_MAG\_CAL \= 2 uses heading fusion at all times\, is recommended if the external magnetic field is varying and is the default for rovers\. EK3\_MAG\_CAL \= 3 uses heading fusion on the ground and 3\-axis fusion after the first in\-air field and yaw reset has completed\, and is the default for copters\. EK3\_MAG\_CAL \= 4 uses 3\-axis fusion at all times\. EK3\_MAG\_CAL \= 5 uses an external yaw sensor with simple heading fusion\. NOTE \: Use of simple heading magnetometer fusion makes vehicle compass calibration and alignment errors harder for the EKF to detect which reduces the sensitivity of the Copter EKF failsafe algorithm\. NOTE\: The fusion mode can be forced to 2 for specific EKF cores using the EK3\_MAG\_MASK parameter\. EK3\_MAG\_CAL \= 6 uses an external yaw sensor with fallback to compass when the external sensor is not available if we are flying\. NOTE\: The fusion mode can be forced to 2 for specific EKF cores using the EK3\_MAG\_MASK parameter\. NOTE\: limited operation without a magnetometer or any other yaw sensor is possible by setting all COMPASS\_USE\, COMPASS\_USE2\, COMPASS\_USE3\, etc parameters to 0 and setting COMPASS\_ENABLE to 0\. If this is done\, the EK3\_GSF\_RUN and EK3\_GSF\_USE masks must be set to the same as EK3\_IMU\_MASK\. A yaw angle derived from IMU and GPS velocity data using a Gaussian Sum Filter \(GSF\) will then be used to align the yaw when flight commences and there is sufficient movement\.

.. _EK3_BETA_MASK:

EK3\_BETA\_MASK: Bitmask controlling sidelip angle fusion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| *Note: This parameter is for advanced users*
| *Note: Reboot required after change*

1 byte bitmap controlling use of sideslip angle fusion for estimation of non wind states during operation of \'fly forward\' vehicle types such as fixed wing planes\. By assuming that the angle of sideslip is small\, the wind velocity state estimates are corrected  whenever the EKF is not dead reckoning \(e\.g\. has an independent velocity or position sensor such as GPS\)\. This behaviour is on by default and cannot be disabled\. When the EKF is dead reckoning\, the wind states are used as a reference\, enabling use of the small angle of sideslip assumption to correct non wind velocity states \(eg attitude\, velocity\, position\, etc\) and improve navigation accuracy\. This behaviour is on by default and cannot be disabled\. The behaviour controlled by this parameter is the use of the small angle of sideslip assumption to correct non wind velocity states when the EKF is NOT dead reckoning\. This is primarily of benefit to reduce the buildup of yaw angle errors during straight and level flight without a yaw sensor \(e\.g\. magnetometer or dual antenna GPS yaw\) provided aerobatic flight maneuvers with large sideslip angles are not performed\. The \'always\' option might be used where the yaw sensor is intentionally not fitted or disabled\. The \'WhenNoYawSensor\' option might be used if a yaw sensor is fitted\, but protection against in\-flight failure and continual rejection by the EKF is desired\. For vehicles operated within visual range of the operator performing frequent turning maneuvers\, setting this parameter is unnecessary\.

When a height sensor other than GPS is used as the primary height source by the EKF\, the position of the zero height datum is defined by that sensor and its frame of reference\. If a GPS height measurement is also available\, then the height of the WGS\-84 height datum used by the EKF can be corrected so that the height returned by the getLLH\(\) function is compensated for primary height sensor drift and change in datum over time\. The first two bit positions control when the height datum will be corrected\. Correction is performed using a Bayes filter and only operates when GPS quality permits\. The third bit position controls where the corrections to the GPS reference datum are applied\. Corrections can be applied to the local vertical position or to the reported EKF origin height \(default\)\.

.. _EK3_DRAG_MCOEF:

EK3\_DRAG\_MCOEF: Momentum coefficient for propeller drag
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| *Note: This parameter is for advanced users*

This parameter is used to predict the drag produced by the rotors when flying a multi\-copter\, enabling estimation of wind drift\. The drag produced by this effect scales with speed not speed squared and is produced because some of the air velocity normal to the rotors axis of rotation is lost when passing through the rotor disc which changes the momentum of the airflow causing drag\. For unducted rotors the effect is roughly proportional to the area of the propeller blades when viewed side on and changes with different propellers\. It is higher for ducted rotors\. For example if flying at 15 m\/s at sea level conditions produces a rotor induced drag acceleration of 1\.5 m\/s\/s\, then EK3\_DRAG\_MCOEF would be set to 0\.1 \= \(1\.5\/15\.0\)\. Set EK3\_MCOEF to a positive value to enable wind estimation using this drag effect\. To account for the drag produced by the body which scales with speed squared\, see documentation for the EK3\_DRAG\_BCOEF\_X and EK3\_DRAG\_BCOEF\_Y parameters\.

If a match is found then the lower frequency harmonic is always used as the basis for the dynamic harmonic notch\. A value of zero completely disables harmonic matching\.


+----------+
| Range    |
+==========+
| 0 to 100 |
+----------+




.. _FFT_HMNC_PEAK:

FFT\_HMNC\_PEAK: FFT harmonic peak target
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| *Note: This parameter is for advanced users*

The FFT harmonic peak target that should be returned by FTN1\.PkAvg\. The resulting value will be used by the harmonic notch if configured to track the FFT frequency\.

Setting this to 1 will always target the highest energy peak\. Setting this to 2 will target the highest energy peak that is lower in frequency than the highest energy peak\. Setting this to 3 will target the highest energy peak that is higher in frequency than the highest energy peak\. Setting this to 4 will target the highest energy peak on the roll axis only and only the roll frequency will be used \(some vehicles have a much more pronounced peak on roll\)\. Setting this to 5 will target the highest energy peak on the pitch axis only and only the pitch frequency will be used \(some vehicles have a much more pronounced peak on roll\)\.

.. _parameters_KDE_:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Sets the number of motor poles to calculate the correct RPM value



.. _parameters_LAND_:

LAND\_ Parameters
-----------------


.. _LAND_SLOPE_RCALC:

LAND\_SLOPE\_RCALC: Landing slope re\-calc threshold
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| *Note: This parameter is for advanced users*

This parameter is used when using a rangefinder during landing for altitude correction from baro drift \(RNGFND\_LANDING\=1\) and the altitude correction indicates your altitude is lower than the intended slope path\. This value is the threshold of the correction to re\-calculate the landing approach slope\. Set to zero to keep the original slope all the way down and any detected baro drift will be corrected by pitching\/throttling up to snap back to resume the original slope path\. Otherwise\, when a rangefinder altitude correction exceeds this threshold it will trigger a slope re\-calculate to give a shallower slope\. This also smoothes out the approach when flying over objects such as trees\. Recommend a value of 2m\.

.. _LAND_ABORT_DEG:

LAND\_ABORT\_DEG: Landing auto\-abort slope threshold
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| *Note: This parameter is for advanced users*

This parameter is used when using a rangefinder during landing for altitude correction from baro drift \(RNGFND\_LANDING\=1\) and the altitude correction indicates your actual altitude is higher than the intended slope path\. Normally it would pitch down steeply but that can result in a crash with high airspeed so this allows remembering the baro offset and self\-abort the landing and come around for another landing with the correct baro offset applied for a perfect slope\. An auto\-abort go\-around will only happen once\, next attempt will not auto\-abort again\. This operation happens entirely automatically in AUTO mode\. This value is the delta degrees threshold to trigger the go\-around compared to the original slope\. Example\: if set to 5 deg and the mission planned slope is 15 deg then if the new slope is 21 then it will go\-around\. Set to 0 to disable\. Requires LAND\_SLOPE\_RCALC \> 0\.

.. _LAND_PITCH_DEG:

LAND\_PITCH\_DEG: Landing Pitch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| *Note: This parameter is for advanced users*

Used in autoland to give the minimum pitch in the final stage of landing \(after the flare\)\. This parameter can be used to ensure that the final landing attitude is appropriate for the type of undercarriage on the aircraft\. Note that it is a minimum pitch only \- the landing code will control pitch above this value to try to achieve the configured landing sink rate\.


+-----------+-----------+---------+

+===========+===========+=========+
| 10        | -20 to 20 | degrees |

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| *Note: This parameter is for advanced users*

Altitude in autoland at which to lock heading and flare to the LAND\_PITCH\_DEG pitch\. Note that this option is secondary to LAND\_FLARE\_SEC\. For a good landing it preferable that the flare is triggered by LAND\_FLARE\_SEC\.

| 4 to 200 | kibibytes |
+----------+-----------+




.. _LOG_DISARMED:

LOG\_DISARMED: Enable logging while disarmed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


If LOG\_DISARMED is set to 1 then logging will be enabled at all times including when disarmed\. Logging before arming can make for very large logfiles but can help a lot when tracking down startup issues and is necessary if logging of EKF replay data is selected via the LOG\_REPLAY parameter\. If LOG\_DISARMED is set to 2\, then logging will be enabled when disarmed\, but not if a USB connection is detected\. This can be used to prevent unwanted data logs being generated when the vehicle is connected via USB for log downloading or parameter changes\. If LOG\_DISARMED is set to 3 then logging will happen while disarmed\, but if the vehicle never arms then the logs using the filesystem backend will be discarded on the next boot\.

.. _parameters_NAVL1_:

NAVL1\_ Parameters
------------------


.. _NAVL1_PERIOD:

NAVL1\_PERIOD: L1 control period
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Period in seconds of L1 tracking loop\. This parameter is the primary control for aggressiveness of turns in auto mode\. This needs to be larger for less responsive airframes\. The default is quite conservative\, but for most RC aircraft will lead to reasonable flight\. For smaller more agile aircraft a value closer to 15 is appropriate\, or even as low as 10 for some very agile aircraft\. When tuning\, change this value in small increments\, as a value that is much too small \(say 5 or 10 below the right value\) can lead to very radical turns\, and a risk of stalling\.


+-----------+---------+---------+
| Increment | Range   | Units   |
+===========+=========+=========+
| 1         | 1 to 60 | seconds |
+-----------+---------+---------+




.. _NAVL1_DAMPING:

NAVL1\_DAMPING: L1 control damping ratio
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| *Note: This parameter is for advanced users*

Damping ratio for L1 control\. Increase this in increments of 0\.05 if you are getting overshoot in path tracking\. You should not need a value below 0\.7 or above 0\.85\.


+-----------+------------+
| Increment | Range      |
+===========+============+
| 0.05      | 0.6 to 1.0 |
+-----------+------------+




.. _NAVL1_XTRACK_I:

NAVL1\_XTRACK\_I: L1 control crosstrack integrator gain
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| *Note: This parameter is for advanced users*

Crosstrack error integrator gain\. This gain is applied to the crosstrack error to ensure it converges to zero\. Set to zero to disable\. Smaller values converge slower\, higher values will cause crosstrack error oscillation\.


+-----------+----------+
| Increment | Range    |
+===========+==========+
| 0.01      | 0 to 0.1 |
+-----------+----------+




.. _NAVL1_LIM_BANK:

.. _Q_VFWD_GAIN:

Q\_VFWD\_GAIN: Forward velocity hold gain
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


The use of this parameter is no longer recommended and has been superseded by a method that works in all VTOL modes with the exception of QAUTOTUNE which is controlled by the Q\_FWD\_THR\_USE parameter\. This Q\_VFD\_GAIN parameter controls use of the forward motor in VTOL modes that use the velocity controller\. Set to 0 to disable this function\. A value of 0\.05 is a good place to start if you want to use the forward motor for position control\. No forward motor will be used in QSTABILIZE or QHOVER modes\. Use with QLOITER for position hold with the forward motor\.

Vehicles using separate forward thrust motors\, eg quadplanes\, should set this parameter to \(all up weight\) \/ \(maximum combined thrust of forward motors\) with a value of 2 being typical\. Vehicles that tilt lifting rotors to provide forward thrust should set this parameter to \(all up weight\) \/ \(weight lifted by tilting rotors\) which for most aircraft can be approximated as \(total number of lifting rotors\) \/ \(number of lifting rotors that tilt\)\. When using this method of forward throttle control\, the forward tilt angle limit is controlled by the Q\_FWD\_PIT\_LIM parameter\.

Q\_FWD\_THR\_USE \= 1 enables the feature in all position controlled modes such as QLOITER\, QLAND\, QRTL and VTOL TAKEOFF\. Q\_FWD\_THR\_USE \= 2 enables the feature in all Q modes except QAUTOTUNE and QACRO\. When enabling the feature\, the legacy method of controlling forward throttle use via velocity controller error should be disabled by setting Q\_VFWD\_GAIN to 0\. Do not use this feature with tailsitters\.

If airspeed is above or below AIRSPEED\_MIN\, the pitch up\/back will be adjusted according to the formula pitch\_limit \= Q\_BCK\_PIT\_LIM \* \(AIRSPEED\_MIN \/ IAS\)\^2\. The backwards\/up pitch limit controlled by this parameter is in addition to limiting applied by PTCH\_LIM\_MAX\_DEG and Q\_ANGLE\_MAX\. The BCK\_PIT\_LIM limit is only applied when Q\_FWD\_THR\_USE is set to 1 or 2 and the vehicle is flying in a mode that uses forward throttle instead of forward tilt to generate forward speed\.

This sets the priority of the scripting thread\. This is normally set to a low priority to prevent scripts from interfering with other parts of the system\. Advanced users can change this priority if scripting needs to be prioritised for realtime applications\. WARNING\: changing this parameter can impact the stability of your flight controller\. The scipting thread priority in this parameter is chosen based on a set of system level priorities for other subsystems\. It is strongly recommended that you use the lowest priority that is sufficient for your application\. Note that all scripts run at the same priority\, so if you raise this priority you must carefully audit all lua scripts for behaviour that does not interfere with the operation of the system\.

.. _SERIAL0_BAUD:

SERIAL0\_BAUD: Serial0 baud rate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


The baud rate used on the USB console\. Most stm32\-based boards can support rates of up to 1500\. If you setup a rate you cannot support and then can\'t connect to your board you should load a firmware from a different vehicle type\. That will reset all your parameters to defaults\.

.. _SERIAL5_BAUD:

SERIAL5\_BAUD: Serial 5 Baud Rate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


The baud rate used for Serial5\. Most stm32\-based boards can support rates of up to 1500\. If you setup a rate you cannot support and then can\'t connect to your board you should load a firmware from a different vehicle type\. That will reset all your parameters to defaults\.

.. _SERIAL_PASS1:

SERIAL\_PASS1: Serial passthru first port
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| *Note: This parameter is for advanced users*

This sets one side of pass\-through between two serial ports\. Once both sides are set then all data received on either port will be passed to the other port


+----------------------+
| Values               |
+======================+
| +-------+----------+ |
| | Value | Meaning  | |

+----------------------+




.. _SERIAL_PASS2:

SERIAL\_PASS2: Serial passthru second port
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| *Note: This parameter is for advanced users*

This sets one side of pass\-through between two serial ports\. Once both sides are set then all data received on either port will be passed to the other port\. This parameter is normally reset to \-1 on reboot\, disabling passthrough\. If SERIAL\_PASSTIMO is set to \-1 then it is not reset on reboot\.


+----------------------+
| Values               |
+======================+
| +-------+----------+ |
| | Value | Meaning  | |
| +=======+==========+ |
| | -1    | Disabled | |

| | 6     | Serial6  | |
| +-------+----------+ |
|                      |
+----------------------+




.. _SERIAL_PASSTIMO:

SERIAL\_PASSTIMO: Serial passthru timeout
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| *Note: This parameter is for advanced users*

This sets a timeout for serial pass\-through in seconds\. When the pass\-through is enabled by setting the SERIAL\_PASS1 and SERIAL\_PASS2 parameters then it remains in effect until no data comes from the first port for SERIAL\_PASSTIMO seconds\. This allows the port to revent to its normal usage \(such as MAVLink connection to a GCS\) when it is no longer needed\. A value of 0 means no timeout\. A value of \-1 means no timeout and the SERIAL\_PASS2 parameter is not reset on reboot\.


+-----------+---------+
| Range     | Units   |
+===========+=========+
| -1 to 120 | seconds |
+-----------+---------+




.. _SERIAL7_PROTOCOL:

SERIAL7\_PROTOCOL: Serial7 protocol selection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| *Note: Reboot required after change*

Control what protocol Serial7 port should be used for\. Note that the Frsky options require external converter hardware\. See the wiki for details\.

.. _SERIAL7_BAUD:

SERIAL7\_BAUD: Serial 7 Baud Rate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


The baud rate used for Serial7\. Most stm32\-based boards can support rates of up to 1500\. If you setup a rate you cannot support and then can\'t connect to your board you should load a firmware from a different vehicle type\. That will reset all your parameters to defaults\.

.. _SERIAL8_BAUD:

SERIAL8\_BAUD: Serial 8 Baud Rate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


The baud rate used for Serial8\. Most stm32\-based boards can support rates of up to 1500\. If you setup a rate you cannot support and then can\'t connect to your board you should load a firmware from a different vehicle type\. That will reset all your parameters to defaults\.

.. _SERVO_VOLZ_RANGE:

SERVO\_VOLZ\_RANGE: Range of travel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Range to map between 1000 and 2000 PWM\. Default value of 200 gives full \+\-100 deg range of extended position command\. This results in 0\.2 deg movement per US change in PWM\. If the full range is not needed it can be reduced to increase resolution\. 40 deg range gives 0\.04 deg movement per US change in PWM\, this is higher resolution than possible with the VOLZ protocol so further reduction in range will not improve resolution\. Reduced range does allow PWMs outside the 1000 to 2000 range\, with 40 deg range 750 PWM results in a angle of \-30 deg\, 2250 would be \+30 deg\. This is still limited by the 200 deg maximum range of the actuator\.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| *Note: This parameter is for advanced users*

This controls the time constant in seconds from demanded to achieved steering angle\. A value of 0\.75 is a good default and will work with nearly all rovers\. Ground steering in aircraft needs a bit smaller time constant\, and a value of 0\.5 is recommended for best ground handling in fixed wing aircraft\. A value of 0\.75 means that the controller will try to correct any deviation between the desired and actual steering angle in 0\.75 seconds\. Advanced users may want to reduce this time to obtain a faster response but there is no point setting a time less than the vehicle can achieve\.

.. _TECS_LAND_ARSPD:

TECS\_LAND\_ARSPD: Airspeed during landing approach \(m\/s\)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


When performing an autonomous landing\, this value is used as the goal airspeed during approach\.  Max airspeed allowed is Trim Airspeed or AIRSPEED\_MAX as defined by LAND\_OPTIONS bitmask\.  Note that this parameter is not useful if your platform does not have an airspeed sensor \(use TECS\_LAND\_THR instead\)\.  If negative then this value is halfway between AIRSPEED\_MIN and AIRSPEED\_CRUISE speed for fixed wing autolandings\.


+-----------+-----------+
| Increment | Range     |
+===========+===========+
| 1         | -1 to 127 |

+-----------+-----------+




.. _TECS_LAND_SPDWGT:

TECS\_LAND\_SPDWGT: Weighting applied to speed control during landing\.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| *Note: This parameter is for advanced users*

Same as SPDWEIGHT parameter\, with the exception that this parameter is applied during landing flight stages\.  A value closer to 2 will result in the plane ignoring height error during landing and our experience has been that the plane will therefore keep the nose up \-\- sometimes good for a glider landing \(with the side effect that you will likely glide a ways past the landing point\)\.  A value closer to 0 results in the plane ignoring speed error \-\- use caution when lowering the value below 1 \-\- ignoring speed could result in a stall\. Values between 0 and 2 are valid values for a fixed landing weight\. When using \-1 the weight will be scaled during the landing\. At the start of the landing approach it starts with TECS\_SPDWEIGHT and scales down to 0 by the time you reach the land point\. Example\: Halfway down the landing approach you\'ll effectively have a weight of TECS\_SPDWEIGHT\/2\.

.. _TECS_LAND_SRC:

TECS\_LAND\_SRC: Land sink rate change
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| *Note: This parameter is for advanced users*

When zero\, the flare sink rate \(TECS\_LAND\_SINK\) is a fixed sink demand\. With this enabled the flare sink rate will increase\/decrease the flare sink demand as you get further beyond the LAND waypoint\. Has no effect before the waypoint\. This value is added to TECS\_LAND\_SINK proportional to distance traveled after wp\. With an increasing sink rate you can still land in a given distance if you\'re traveling too fast and cruise passed the land point\. A positive value will force the plane to land sooner proportional to distance passed land point\. A negative number will tell the plane to slowly climb allowing for a pitched\-up stall landing\. Recommend 0\.2 as initial value\.

| Increment | Range       | Units                       |

TERRAIN\_ Parameters
--------------------


.. _TERRAIN_ENABLE:

TERRAIN\_ENABLE: Terrain data enable
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| *Note: This parameter is for advanced users*

enable terrain data\. This enables the vehicle storing a database of terrain data on the SD card\. The terrain data is requested from the ground station as needed\, and stored for later use on the SD card\. To be useful the ground station must support TERRAIN\_REQUEST messages and have access to a terrain database\, such as the SRTM database\.


+---------------------+

+---------------------+




.. _TERRAIN_SPACING:

TERRAIN\_SPACING: Terrain grid spacing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| *Note: This parameter is for advanced users*

Distance between terrain grid points in meters\. This controls the horizontal resolution of the terrain data that is stored on te SD card and requested from the ground station\. If your GCS is using the ArduPilot SRTM database like Mission Planner or MAVProxy\, then a resolution of 100 meters is appropriate\. Grid spacings lower than 100 meters waste SD card space if the GCS cannot provide that resolution\. The grid spacing also controls how much data is kept in memory during flight\. A larger grid spacing will allow for a larger amount of data in memory\. A grid spacing of 100 meters results in the vehicle keeping 12 grid squares in memory with each grid square having a size of 2\.7 kilometers by 3\.2 kilometers\. Any additional grid squares are stored on the SD once they are fetched from the GCS and will be loaded as needed\.

.. _TERRAIN_MARGIN:

TERRAIN\_MARGIN: Acceptance margin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| *Note: This parameter is for advanced users*

Margin in centi\-meters to accept terrain data from the GCS\. This can be used to allow older terrain data generated with less accurate latitude\/longitude scaling to be used


+---------------+--------+
| Range         | Units  |
+===============+========+
| 0.05 to 50000 | meters |
+---------------+--------+




.. _TERRAIN_OFS_MAX:

TERRAIN\_OFS\_MAX: Terrain reference offset maximum
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| *Note: This parameter is for advanced users*

The maximum adjustment of terrain altitude based on the assumption that the vehicle is on the ground when it is armed\. When the vehicle is armed the location of the vehicle is recorded\, and when terrain data is available for that location a height adjustment for terrain data is calculated that aligns the terrain height at that location with the altitude recorded at arming\. This height adjustment is applied to all terrain data\. This parameter clamps the amount of adjustment\. A value of zero disables the use of terrain height adjustment\.

.. _TKOFF_LVL_ALT:

TKOFF\_LVL\_ALT: Takeoff mode altitude level altitude
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


This is the altitude below which the wings are held level for TAKEOFF and AUTO modes\. Below this altitude\, roll demand is restricted to LEVEL\_ROLL\_LIMIT\. Normal\-flight roll restriction resumes above TKOFF\_LVL\_ALT\*3 or TKOFF\_ALT\, whichever is lower\. Roll limits are scaled while between TKOFF\_LVL\_ALT and those altitudes for a smooth transition\.

+-----------+----------+--------+




.. _TKOFF_GND_PITCH:

TKOFF\_GND\_PITCH: Takeoff run pitch demand
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Degrees of pitch angle demanded during the takeoff run before speed reaches TKOFF\_ROTATE\_SPD\. For taildraggers set to 3\-point ground pitch angle and use TKOFF\_TDRAG\_ELEV to prevent nose tipover\. For nose\-wheel steer aircraft set to the ground pitch angle and if a reduction in nose\-wheel load is required as speed rises\, use a positive offset in TKOFF\_GND\_PITCH of up to 5 degrees above the angle on ground\, starting at the measured pitch angle and incrementing in 1 degree steps whilst checking for premature rotation and takeoff with each increment\. To increase nose\-wheel load\, use a negative TKOFF\_TDRAG\_ELEV and refer to notes on TKOFF\_TDRAG\_ELEV before making adjustments\.
