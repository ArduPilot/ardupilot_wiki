.. code:: bash

    module load tuneopt
    
This module manages the action mapped to channel 6. It is used for
multicopters only. Use ``tuneopt [set|show|reset|list]`` to manage the
mapped action. For the ``set`` command, use the format
``tuneopt set [OPTION] [LOW] [HIGH]`` to map a tuning action and its
range of values.
