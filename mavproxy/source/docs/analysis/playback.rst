Playback
========

The logfiles (\*.tlog) generated by MAVProxy (or other ground station
programs) during flight can be played back through MAVProxy. This is
done via streaming the logfile through a local port and connecting
MAVProxy to that port.

Any commands that propagate up to the UAV will not function during
playback mode.

.. code:: bash

    mavplayback.py logfile.tlog

This will stream MAVLink over ``127.0.0.1:14550``. Thus MAVProxy can be
connected to it via:

.. code:: bash

    mavproxy.py --master=127.0.0.1:14550

The playback program will have a small GUI to pause, fast forward and
slow down the playback speed.

The output IP address and port can be overridden via the ``--out`` commandline
argument:

.. code:: bash

    mavplayback.py logfile.tlog --out=127.0.0.1:14550
