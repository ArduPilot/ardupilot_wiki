Module Development
==================

This section is a quick tutorial on how to create custom modules in
MAVProxy.

Location
========

If developing from the MAVProxy source code, modules are placed in the
``MAVProxy/modules`` folder. Then the ``setup.py build install --user``
routine needs to be run in order to (re)install MAVProxy and the modules
in this folder which will be automatically picked up and become part of
the installation.

.. note::

    MAVProxy modules will not be able to detect and run any modules not compiled
    as part of the above ``setup.py``. This is because MAVProxy runs modules
    from the Python package install directory, not the MAVProxy source code
    directory.

The module can then be loaded then using the ``module load myModule`` in 
MAVProxy.

Module File Structure
=====================

At the base level, a MAVProxy module is an instance of the MPModule
class, with hooks for initialisation and reading Mavlink packets:

.. code:: python

    #!/usr/bin/env python
    '''module template'''
    import time, math
    from pymavlink import mavutil
    from MAVProxy.modules.lib import mp_module
    from MAVProxy.modules.lib.mp_settings import MPSetting
    
    class TestModule(mp_module.MPModule):
      def __init__(self, mpstate):
        super(TestModule, self).__init__(mpstate, "test", "test module")
        '''initialisation code'''

      def mavlink_packet(self, m):
        '''handle a mavlink packet'''
        
      def init(mpstate):
        '''initialise module'''
        return TestModule(mpstate)           ``

The initialisation section defines commands and module-wide variables.
To add a command:

.. code:: python

    self.add_command('bat', self.cmd_bat, "show some information")

The above will add the "bat" command to MAVProxy, which the MAVProxy help will show
"show some information" and the ``self.cmd\_bat`` function will be run.

Within the packet handling, the
`Mavlink <https://pixhawk.ethz.ch/mavlink/>`_ reference is useful for
filtering the incoming packets for the relevant data:

.. code:: python

    if m.get_type() == 'VFR_HUD':
      curspeed =  m.airspeed

The above example will set the variable ``curspeed`` to the current 
airspeed of the vehicle, whenever a ``VFR_HUD`` packet is received.

There are a great number of MAVProxy modules, so the best reference
would be to look through the these
`modules <https://github.com/ArduPilot/MAVProxy/tree/master/MAVProxy/modules>`_
for examples of what you want to do.

In particular, the ``example`` module (mavproxy_example.py) provides annotated code of many 
common tasks that can be performed with modules.
