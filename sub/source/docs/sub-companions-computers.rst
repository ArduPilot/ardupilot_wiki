Companion Computers for Sub
===========================

Underwater ROVs often employ a small companion computer, in addition to the :ref:`ArduPilot autopilot <common-autopilots>` to manage video cameras and sophisticated peripherals like SideScan Sonar as an adjunct to ArduPilot's basic vehicle control and mission execution functions. Companion computers communicate with the autopilot over a fast link, often a UART, using MAVLink messages.

ArduPilot compatible companion computers are listed :ref:`HERE <companion-computers>`.

`Blue Robotics <https://bluerobotics.com/>`__ offers a highly functional, open source, companion computer firmware system that runs on a Raspberry Pi 3, 4, or 5 <https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/>`__ for vehicles called `BlueOS <https://blueos.cloud/docs/latest/usage/overview/>`__.
