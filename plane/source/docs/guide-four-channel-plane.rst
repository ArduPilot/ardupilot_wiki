===================
Four Channel Planes
===================

The most common type of fixed wing plane is a 4 channel plane. As the
name implies, it has 4 output channels, and they control the roll, pitch, yaw,
and throttle independently.

These are the default outputs for Arduplane as it is such a common
setup. It is commonly referred to as an AETR setup.

.. warning:: Remove the propeller from your aircraft before
             starting your setup.

Setting Up Your Plane
=====================

The most important step to setting up the plane is having the correct inputs, 
outputs, and reversals. Inputs are covered on the :ref:`RC input setup page <rc-throw-trim>`. 
After the RC inputs are configured, configure the outputs.

.. warning:: Make sure the AHRS_ORIENT is set correctly for the autopilot. If it is incorrect, 
             this setup will fail, and the plane may crash upon entry into any stabilize mode.
             
Servo cables can be connected to any output of the autopilot,
but using the default channels 1-4 listed below is recommended. 
Set the SERVOn_FUNCTIONS to the appropriate values.

.. raw:: html

   <table border="1" class="docutils">
   <tr><th>Parameter</th><th>Value</th><th>Meaning</th></tr>
   <tr><td>SERVO1_FUNCTION</td><td>4</td><td>aileron</td></tr>
   <tr><td>SERVO2_FUNCTION</td><td>19</td><td>elevator</td></tr>
   <tr><td>SERVO3_FUNCTION</td><td>70</td><td>throttle</td></tr>
   <tr><td>SERVO4_FUNCTION</td><td>21</td><td>rudder</td></tr>
   </table>
   
.. tip:: Most 4-channel aircraft utilize a Y-splitter for ailerons. It works well if 
         the servos have equal travel ranges and mirrored movement. If you wish to set
         the trim, max, or min values for each aileron servo independently, then use
         another output like channel 5 for the second aileron. Be sure to set that
         channel's function correctly (4). This principle applies to any additional
         servo or motor output.

Servo Function & Reversal
=========================

The next step is to correct the servo reversals. 
Connect the battery (with propeller removed) and turn on the RC transmitter.
Switch to FBWA mode using the function switch or a ground station command, and 
disable the safety switch (if fitted). We use FBWA for setup because it prevents
double-reversing inputs and outputs. Double-reversing causes correct manual
behavior, but dangerous and destabilizing behavior in other flight modes.

When the plane is level, the servos should be near their trim (neutral) values. 
Move the plane and leave the transmitter sticks centered while 
monitoring the control surfaces to determine if the reversals are correct.
See the table for the correct control surface response to the movements. 
In each instance, the plane should move its control surfaces to level itself
and coordinate its turns.

.. raw:: html

   <table border="1" class="docutils">
   <tr><th>Movement</th><th>Action</th></tr>
   <tr><td>Roll Plane Right</td><td>Left aileron moves up and right aileron moves down</td><tr>
   <tr><td>Roll Plane Left</td><td>Left aileron moves down and right aileron moves up</td><tr>
   <tr><td>Pitch plane up</td><td>Elevator moves down</td></tr>
   <tr><td>Pitch plane down</td><td>Elevator moves up</td></tr>
   <tr><td>Roll Plane Right</td><td>Rudder moves left</td></tr>
   <tr><td>Roll Plane Left</td><td>Rudder moves right</td></tr>
   </table>

If the any of the control surfaces do not respond correctly, reverse the 
output by changing the corresponding SERVOn_REVERSED setting (from 0 to 1, 
or from 1 to 0).

.. note:: KFF_RDDRMIX mut not be set to 0 for rudder setup. If the 
          plane actually needs 0, then reset it after this setup.

          KFF_RDDRMIX should cause the tail surfaces point away from the 
          direction of the lowered aileron. This corrects adverse yaw caused
          by the additional drag of a lowered aileron.

Confirm RC Transmitter Input
============================

Keep the plane level in FBWA mode and command the following inputs:

.. raw:: html
         
   <table border="1" class="docutils">
   <tr><th>Input</th><th>Action</th></tr>
   <tr><td>Roll Right</td><td>Right aileron moves up and left aileron moves down</td><tr>
   <tr><td>Roll Left</td><td>Left aileron moves up and right aileron moves down</td><tr>
   <tr><td>Pitch up</td><td>Elevator moves up</td><tr>
   <tr><td>Pitch down</td><td>Elevator moves down</td><tr>
   <tr><td>Yaw right</td><td>Rudder moves right</td><tr>
   <tr><td>Yaw left</td><td>Rudder moves left</td><tr>
   </table>

If the control surfaces do not respond correctly, change the RCn_reversed
parameter (from 0 to 1, or from 1 to 0). Double check MANUAL mode for the
same inputs. If everything is setup correctly, the plane should be almost
ready to fly.

Servo Trim
==========

Switch to MANUAL mode in order to adjust the servo trim
values. The servo trim is in the SERVOn_TRIM parameters.

Adjust the trim values so that the servo is centered when
the transmitter sticks are centered. If the trim value is not 
between 1450 and 1550 PWM, mechanical trim adjustment is recommended.

Servo Throw
===========

Finally adjust the servo throws (range of
movement for each of the servos).

Check any instructions that came with the plane for suggested throw
values. These are often specified in millimeters or inches of movement
of the trailing edge of the control surface close to the fuselage. If
suggested throw values are not found, then choose a throw that doesn't 
cause the servos to "bind" (often indicated by a high pitched sound 
when servos stall).

To adjust the throw, change the SERVOn_MIN and SERVOn_MAX values. The
defaults are 1100 to 1900. On many aircraft, more throw may be desired.
Changing throws to 1000 to 2000 or beyond is normal. Make sure that 
the servos are still moving when nearing the extrememe values.

Final Setup
===========
