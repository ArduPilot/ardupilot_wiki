STABILIZE Mode
==============

RC control with simple stabilization. If you let go of the sticks then
Plane will level the plane. This is a bit like flying a plane with a lot
of dihedral. You will find that while it is possible to do maneuvers
like rolls and loops in stabilize mode, the tendency of the plane to
right itself will make these maneuvers difficult. For people wanting the
plane to mostly fly itself, with the pilot just telling it where to fly,
you are better off using the :ref:`FLY BY WIRE_A (FBWA) <fbwa-mode>` mode.

In stabilize mode the throttle is limited by the ``THR_MIN`` and
``THR_MAX`` settings.

.. note::

   STABILIZE mode is not a good mode to use for tuning the control
   loops. You are far better off using :ref:`FLY BY WIRE_A (FBWA) <fbwa-mode>` for that.
