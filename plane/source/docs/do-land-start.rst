===================
Using DO_LAND_START
===================

The :ref:`DO_LAND_START <mav_cmd_do_land_start>` mission item can be used
for two purposes:

#. To provide an automatic re-attempt for an aborted NAV_LAND autolanding in a mission. (See :ref:`aborting-autolanding`)
#. To provide an automatic landing for an RTL.

To trigger an automatic landing as part of an RTL
(return to launch) you need to do two things:

-  add a :ref:`DO_LAND_START <mav_cmd_do_land_start>`
   mission item to your mission, just before the start of your landing
   sequence which sets up the approach waypoints and ends with a NAV_LAND item.
-  set the :ref:`RTL_AUTOLAND <RTL_AUTOLAND>`
   parameter to 1 or 2

The way it works is that when the plane enters an RTL it checks to see
if the parameter RTL_AUTOLAND is set to 1 or 2. If it is 1 or 2, then the
current mission is searched for a mission item of type ``DO_LAND_START``.
If one is found then the plane will automatically enter AUTO mode and
land, starting at the part of the mission just after the
``DO_LAND_START`` marker.

The exact behaviour depends on the :ref:`RTL_AUTOLAND<RTL_AUTOLAND>` value:

-  If :ref:`RTL_AUTOLAND<RTL_AUTOLAND>` = 1, then the plane will first RTL as normal, then
   when it starts circling the return point (home or a rally point) it
   will then switch to the AUTO mission after the ``DO_LAND_START`` 
-  If :ref:`RTL_AUTOLAND<RTL_AUTOLAND>` = 2, then the plane will bypass the RTL completely
   and go straight to the landing sequence after the ``DO_LAND_START``.

You can optionally include more than one ``DO_LAND_START`` mission item
in your mission. If that is done then the latitude/longitude/altitude of the
``DO_LAND_START`` mission items is used to choose which landing sequence
to use. The ``DO_LAND_START`` closest to the current location in all three dimensions is used.
This can be useful if you have multiple landing sequences for different
wind conditions or different areas.

.. note:: ArduPilot checks to see if there is a ``DO_LAND_START`` mission items before arming, and :ref:`RTL_AUTOLAND<RTL_AUTOLAND>` is set to 0. If so, a pre-arm failure condition will prevent arming. If it is desired to use a ``DO_LAND_START`` only for aborted autolandings and not as an RTL action override, then set :ref:`RTL_AUTOLAND<RTL_AUTOLAND>` = 3, to allow arming. Its use for an aborted autolanding is explained in :ref:`aborting-autolanding`.
