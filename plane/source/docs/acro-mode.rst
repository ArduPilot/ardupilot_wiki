ACRO Mode
=========

ACRO (for acrobatic) is a mode for advanced users that provides rate
based stabilization with attitude lock. It is a good choice for people
who want to push their plane harder than you can in :ref:`FLY BY WIRE_A (FBWA) <fbwa-mode>` or :ref:`STABILIZE <stabilize-mode>` mode without
flying in :ref:`MANUAL <manual-mode>`. This is the mode to use for rolls,
loops and other basic aerobatic maneuvers, or if you just want an "on
rails" manual flying mode.

To setup this mode you need to set :ref:`ACRO_ROLL_RATE <ACRO_ROLL_RATE>`
and :ref:`ACRO_PITCH_RATE <ACRO_PITCH_RATE>`.
These default to 180 degrees/second, and control how responsive your
plane will be about each axis.

When flying in ACRO the aircraft will try to hold it's existing attitude
if you have no stick input. So if you roll the plane to a 30 degree bank
angle with 10 degrees pitch and then let go of the sticks, the plane
should hold that attitude. This applies upside down as well, so if you
roll the plane upside down and let go of the sticks the plane will try
to hold the inverted attitude until you move the sticks again.

When you apply aileron or elevator stick the plane will rotate about
that axis (in body frame) at a rate proportional to the amount of stick
movement. So if you apply half deflection on the aileron stick then the
plane will start rolling at half of ``ACRO_ROLL_RATE``.

So to perform a simple horizontal roll, just start in level flight then
hold the aileron stick hard over while leaving the elevator stick alone.
The plane will apply elevator correction to try to hold your pitch while
rolling, including applying inverse elevator while inverted.

In the current implementation the controller won't use rudder while the
plane is on it's side to hold pitch, which means horizontal rolls won't
be as smooth as a good manual pilot, but that should be fixed in a
future release. This also means that it won't hold knife-edge flight.

Performing a loop is just as simple - just start with wings level then
pull back on the elevator stick while leaving the aileron alone. The
controller will try to hold your roll attitude through the loop. You can
stop the loop upside down if you like as part of maneuvers such as
Immelman turns or cuban eights.

Note that if you are using ACRO mode to try and teach yourself aerobatic
flying then it is highly recommended that you setup a
:ref:`geo-fence <geofencing>` in case you get disoriented.

.. warning::

   It is very easy to stall your plane in ACRO mode, and if you
   stall you should change to MANUAL mode to recover.

-  make sure you know the limitations of your airframe, and what the
   correct stall recovery procedure is. This varies a lot between
   airframes. Search for stall recovery tutorials for R/C aircraft and
   read them
-  don't overload your airframe, only fly ACRO mode with a lightly
   loaded plane
-  make sure you have enough airspeed for whatever maneuver you are
   attempting. Throttle and speed control is completely under manual
   pilot control in ACRO mode
-  practice stall recovery before trying anything too fancy. Make sure
   you practice when you have plenty of altitude to give you time to try
   different recovery strategies

It can be a lot of fun flying ACRO mode, but you can also easily stall
and crash hard. Automatic stall detection and recovery in autopilots is
an area of research, and is not yet implemented in Plane, so if you do
stall then recovery is up to you. The best mode for recovery is MANUAL.
