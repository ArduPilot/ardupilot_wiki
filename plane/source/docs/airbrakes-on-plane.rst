Airbrakes
==========

`Airbrakes <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_brake_(aeronautics)>`__ are control surfaces that primarily add drag to your aircraft. 

These control surfaces can be driven by:

 - manual input via an RC channel.
 - automatic airbrake control, especially useful for steeper and more accurate automatic landing.
 - a combination of both, in which case the greater value is used.

Servo Output
============

Connect the airbrake servo to a servo output channel on your autopilot. Set the corresponding servo output function to Airbrake (110). Set the servo minimum value SERVOX_MIN to the value for airbrake fully retracted. Set the maximum value SERVOX_MAX to the value for airbrake fully deployed.



RC Channel Input
================

Assign a spare RC channel on your transmitter to a dial, slider or 3 position switch. On the autopilot, ensure this channel is calibrated and assign this channel the RC channel ``RCx_OPTION`` option Airbrake (210).

Automatic Airbrake Setup
========================

You can have airbrakes automatically used in an automated landing or in conjunction with :ref:`Reverse Thrust<reverse-thrust-setup>` operation during certain throttled controlled modes or automatic landings and throttle-controlled descents, such as CRUISE mode while soaring. If manual control of reverse thrust has been enabled using the ``RCX_OPTION`` (64) or airbraking while in final flare in automatic landing using reverse thrust, then the airbrake deployment will be the greater of either the automatic demand or manual control.

Use With Reverse Thrust on Motor
--------------------------------

Setup :ref:`Reverse Thrust<reverse-thrust-setup>` as desired. Airbrake operation will be in sync with reverse throttle applied.

Use Without Reverse Thrust ESC
------------------------------

Same as above, however:

- Set :ref:`SERVO3_TRIM<SERVO3_TRIM>` = :ref:`SERVO3_MIN<SERVO3_MIN>` assuming SERVO 3 output is the throttle. This will assure that low stick and minimum demanded throttle is always SERVOx_MIN.
