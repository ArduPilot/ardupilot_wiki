RTL Mode (Return To Launch)
===========================

In RTL mode the plane will return to its home location (the point where the
plane armed - assuming it had GPS lock) and loiter there until given
alternate instructions (or it runs out of fuel!). As with :ref:`AUTO <auto-mode>` mode
you can also "nudge" the aircraft manually in this mode using stick
mixing (assuming the RTL was not a result of RC failsafe).

The target altitude for RTL mode is set using the :ref:`ALT_HOLD_RTL <ALT_HOLD_RTL>` parameter in centimeters. When initiated below :ref:`ALT_HOLD_RTL <ALT_HOLD_RTL>`, Plane will immediately climb at maximum allowable rate to reach that altitude, if above, it will descend in a linear manner versus distance to home, reaching that altitude at the home loiter point.

The loiter radius at home is determined by :ref:`RTL_RADIUS<RTL_RADIUS>`, if it's non-zero, otherwise :ref:`WP_LOITER_RAD<WP_LOITER_RAD>` is used. Clock-wise or Counter-Clock-wise circling can be set by positive or negative values for the radius.

Additionally, in firmware versions 4.0.6 and later, by setting :ref:`RTL_CLIMB_MIN<RTL_CLIMB_MIN>` to a non-zero value, the plane will climb that many meters, limited in bank angle by :ref:`LEVEL_ROLL_LIMIT<LEVEL_ROLL_LIMIT>` degrees until the additional altitude is reached, then begin the above return to home action from that altitude.

To prevent the vehicle from turning until the return atlitude is reached, if below that value(:ref:`ALT_HOLD_RTL <ALT_HOLD_RTL>` + :ref:`RTL_CLIMB_MIN<RTL_CLIMB_MIN>`), set bit 4 of the :ref:`FLIGHT_OPTIONS<FLIGHT_OPTIONS>` bitmask.

Alternatively, you may :ref:`configure the plane to return to a Rally Point <common-rally-points>`, rather than the home location.

RTL_AUTOLAND
============

It is possible to setup an :ref:`automatic-landing` to be executed when entering RTL. See :ref:`do_land_start` for details. You must have setup your vehicle to properly do a automatic landing, of course.

.. warning::

   "Home" position is always supposed to be your Plane's actual
   GPS takeoff location:

   #. It is very important to acquire GPS lock before arming in order for
      RTL, Loiter, Auto or any GPS dependent mode to work properly.
   #. For Plane the home position is initially established at the time the
      plane acquires its GPS lock. It is then continuously updated as long as
      the autopilot is disarmed.

      - This means if you execute an RTL in Plane, it will return to the
	location where it was when it was armed - assuming it had
	acquired GPS lock.
      - Consider the use of :ref:`Rally Points <common-rally-points>` to
	avoid returning directly to your arming point on RTL
