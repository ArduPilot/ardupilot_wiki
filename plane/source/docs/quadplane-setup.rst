    Frame Setup <quadplane-frame-setup>
    Tilt-Rotors <guide-tilt-rotor>
    Tailsitters <guide-tailsitter>
    ESC Calibration <quadplane-esc-calibration>
    Parameter Setup <quadplane-parameters>
    Flight Modes <quadplane-flight-modes>
    QuadPlane Setup Tips <quadplane-tips>

.. note:: large QuadPlanes will benefit from calibrating the accelerometer on the bench prior to installation, as detailed in the :ref:`common-accelerometer-calibration` instructions, as well as using the :ref:`large-vehicle-mag-cal`.
