GUIDED Mode
===========

The GUIDED mode is used when you want the aircraft to fly to a specific
point on the map without setting up a mission. Most ground control
stations support a "click to fly to" feature where you can click a point
on the map and the aircraft will fly to that location then loiter.

The other major use for GUIDED mode is in :ref:`geo-fencing <geofencing>`.
When the geo-fence is breached the aircraft will enter GUIDED mode, and
head to the predefined geo-fence return point, where it will loiter
until the operator takes over.
