Plane Configuration
===================

This section contains topics related to configuring and testing Plane
components, including those required for the operation of the autopilot.

.. note::

   In addition to the configuration discussed in this section, you
   may also choose to :ref:`Configure Optional Hardware <common-optional-hardware>` including battery monitor, sonar,
   airspeed sensor, optical flow, OSD, camera gimbal, antenna tracker
   etc.
   
.. note::  :ref:`ARSPD_TYPE<ARSPD_TYPE>`  defaults to MS4525. If you don't have an Airspeed sensor or don't have an MS4525 then you should change it and other airspeed related parameters, appropriately.
