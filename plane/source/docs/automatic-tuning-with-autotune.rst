Automatic Tuning with AUTOTUNE
==============================

Getting a good set of roll/pitch tuning parameters for your aircraft is
essential for stable, accurate flight. To help with this it is highly
recommended that you use the AUTOTUNE system described below.

What AUTOTUNE does
==================

The AUTOTUNE mode is a flight mode that flies in the same way as FBWA,
but uses changes in flight attitude input by the pilot to learn the key
values for roll and pitch tuning. So the pilot uses their transmitter
mode switch to switch to AUTOTUNE mode and then flies the plane for a
few minutes. While flying the pilot needs to input as many sharp
attitude changes as possible so that the autotune code can learn how the
aircraft responds.

Setting up for AUTOTUNE
=======================

To setup your aircraft for AUTOTUNE you need to select AUTOTUNE mode as
one of the flight modes selectable with the flight mode switch on your
transmitter.

.. note:: you can AutoTune in most stabilized flight modes, such as CRUISE or FBWA/B, LOITER, or even during an AUTO mission segment (if :ref:`STICK_MIXING<STICK_MIXING>` is enabled), via an ``RCx_OPTION`` switch set to 107.

.. warning:: Large QuadPlanes can be difficult to fly manually while monitoring the GCS for tune progress messages or if you are not experienced in flying in pilot guided modes. In these cases, it is safer to do the tuning while in a repeating fixed course mission (ie. a rectangular loop for example) in AUTO or while LOITERing, using the the above RC Aux Switch to enable autotuning while not having to constantly guide the vehicle on course.

You also should choose a tuning level by setting the :ref:`AUTOTUNE_LEVEL<AUTOTUNE_LEVEL>`
parameter in the advanced parameter screen of your ground station. The
:ref:`AUTOTUNE_LEVEL<AUTOTUNE_LEVEL>` parameter controls how aggressive you want the tune to
be. The default is level 6, which produces a medium tune, suitable for
beginner to intermediate pilots. If you are a more experienced pilot
then you could choose level 7, which will result in a bit sharper tune
(faster attitude changes). Levels above 7 are not recommended until you
have done an initial tune with a lower level. Levels above 8 should only
be used by very experienced pilots.

You can also autotune the yaw axis during AUTOTUNE for yaw rate control in :ref:`ACRO mode <acro-mode>` by setting :ref:`YAW_RATE_ENABLE<YAW_RATE_ENABLE>` = 1. Tuning the yaw axis can only be done in AUTOTUNE mode, or using the ``RCx_OPTION`` switch set to 107, but only in ACRO mode with :ref:`YAW_RATE_ENABLE<YAW_RATE_ENABLE>` = 1.

.. note:: with Yaw rate controller active, turning in AUTOTUNE mode will require the use of rudder, not just aileron input. Do not enable :ref:`YAW_RATE_ENABLE<YAW_RATE_ENABLE>` if you do not have a rudder.

Autotune tunes the FF (feedforward), P, I, and D terms at each :ref:`AUTOTUNE_LEVEL<AUTOTUNE_LEVEL>`, which determines the maximum/target slew rates used for the tuning process and the gain from desired attitude angle to demanded angular rate ( :ref:`PTCH2SRV_TCONST<PTCH2SRV_TCONST>` and :ref:`RLL2SRV_TCONST<RLL2SRV_TCONST>`).

It is important to set a level appropriate for the rates that the aircraft can physically achieve.
In particular, the level 6 roll rates can be too large for slow aircraft with large wing spans,
like gliders. These often have a maximum roll rate of 30 - 40 degrees per second and should use
level 2 or 3. See :ref:`automatic-tuning-with-autotune_level-settings` for the rates. But level 8 may be appropriate for light foam planes in the under 2kg class.

.. note:: the :ref:`PTCH2SRV_RMAX_UP<PTCH2SRV_RMAX_UP>`, :ref:`PTCH2SRV_RMAX_DN<PTCH2SRV_RMAX_DN>`, and :ref:`RLL2SRV_RMAX<RLL2SRV_RMAX>` rates should be set appropriately for normal flight also according to the vehicle's capabilities.

You also need to make sure that all of the basic settings for your
airframe are correct. In particular, ensure that all surface reversals
are correct and that you have a reasonable value set for the minimum
airspeed. Autotune won't do anything until you are above the minimum
airspeed you have set in the :ref:`ARSPD_FBW_MIN<ARSPD_FBW_MIN>` parameter. If you don't
have an airspeed sensor then that value is still used, along with an
airspeed estimate from other sensors. Also make sure you have done RC
calibration, as AUTOTUNE will only work if you have full control
movements with your transmitter sticks.

In addition, ArduPilot will automatically scale the tuning gains versus airspeed, either measured or estimated (if no airspeed sensor is used), to compensate for the control surface effectiveness vs speed. The nominal center speed for this is :ref:`SCALING_SPEED<SCALING_SPEED>` and should be set to the approximate speed that will be used for tuning, ie the typical cruising speed. Once tuning is done with this speed set, do not change it since it directly scales the gains and will corrupt the tune.

Other things to check:

- if you have an airspeed sensor fitted then make sure it is working and you have calibrated it. See the section on :ref:`airspeed calibration <calibrating-an-airspeed-sensor>`.
- check your center of gravity, making sure it is correct according to the manual for your aircraft. In general it is safer to be a bit more
   nose heavy than tail heavy.
- check your surface trims. It is recommended to use the :ref:`SERVO_AUTO_TRIM<SERVO_AUTO_TRIM>` option after reading the documentation for that option.
- make sure your failsafe settings are setup correctly. Try turning off your transmitter with your plane on the ground (and propeller removed or made safe) and check how the plane reacts
- setup a rally point for a safe place to RTL if needed other than home
- make sure that the :ref:`PTCH_RATE_SMAX<PTCH_RATE_SMAX>` and :ref:`RLL_RATE_SMAX<RLL_RATE_SMAX>` parameters are appropriately set for your servos speeds. See :ref:`common-servo-limit-cycle-detection`. If these are set too low, then the tune will be impacted.

Flying in AUTOTUNE
==================

Once you are all setup you can start flying in AUTOTUNE mode. You can
either takeoff in AUTOTUNE mode, or takeoff in another mode and switch
to AUTOTUNE once you have gained altitude.

When you engage AUTOTUNE mode a few things will happen:

-  the autotune system will immediately setup some values for
   your roll and pitch maximum
   rates and angle error to demanded rate gain. These values depend on the :ref:`AUTOTUNE_LEVEL<AUTOTUNE_LEVEL>` 
-  the autotune system will monitor your demanded roll and pitch rates
   (as determined by your transmitter stick movements). When the
   demanded roll or pitch rate (or yaw rate if :ref:`YAW_RATE_ENABLE<YAW_RATE_ENABLE>` = 1) exceeds 40% of the maximum tuning target axis rate set by the ref:`AUTOTUNE_LEVEL<AUTOTUNE_LEVEL>`,(not stick deflection) the autotune system will use the response of the aircraft to learn the tuning values. So sharp stick movements are required with a slight pause at moderate to maximum stick deflections in each direction.
-  the autotune system will save the P and D parameters once the tune has been completed for an axis.  When you switch out of AUTOTUNE mode the FF and I values will be saved. Switching out of AUTOTUNE in the midst of tuning an axis will revert the PID values to their original values.
-  If you are starting with the default parameters for roll and pitch
   you may find the plane is quite sluggish when you first enter
   AUTOTUNE. You will find that as the tune progresses this will get
   better. Make sure your flight area has plenty of room for long slow
   turns.

The key to a successful Autotune is to input rapid roll or pitch
movements with the transmitter sticks. It is best only do one axis at a time, although tuning is occurring simultaneously on all axes being tuned, so tuning messages may be interleaved occasionally.

So rapid stick movements with short pauses at each deflection is used for each axis in turn until the tuning finished message is reported on GCS or OSD.

If your initial tuning values were too low then you should notice the
aircraft becomes progressively more responsive as you fly in AUTOTUNE
mode.

-  Stop increasing the :ref:`AUTOTUNE_LEVEL<AUTOTUNE_LEVEL>` on successive autotune sessions when the desired feel and responsiveness is obtained, oscillations occur, or it becomes "twitchy" in an axis.


Don't stop too early
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you cannot monitor the tune progress with a GCS or OSD, it is recommended that you do at least 20 rapid movements in each axis, preferably  more. Stopping before all axes are finished tuning will result in a poorly flying aircraft. Keep flying and exercising the sticks in AUTOTUNE mode well past the point where you think the plane is flying
well.

Tuning light, agile aircraft
----------------------------

Very light, agile aircraft may fail to complete the tune, or result in a tune that has small oscillations, often in the pitch axis since it has low inertia. In these cases, it may be beneficial to do the following and re-attempt the Autotune:

- Increase the main loop rate, :ref:`SCHED_LOOP_RATE<SCHED_LOOP_RATE>` to "200" (Hz) and set the :ref:`ONESHOT_MASK<ONESHOT_MASK>` to those outputs controlling flight surface control servos (if they are capable of doing 200Hz updates...most digital servos are capable of this...check to see that they are not overheating as you move them). This increases the control update rate and decreases delay, increasing phase margin to attempt to eliminate small oscillations and increase accuracy.

- Set the :ref:`INS_GYRO_FILTER<INS_GYRO_FILTER>` to "40" (Hz) cutoff and increase the :ref:`PTCH_RATE_FLTT<PTCH_RATE_FLTT>` and :ref:`RLL_RATE_FLTT<RLL_RATE_FLTT>` to "20" (Hz) to reduce delay and increase phase margin.

.. note:: increasing the gyro filter cutof may allow more system noise into the control loops and setting up a :ref:`dynamic throttle notch filter<common-throttle-based-notch>` or :ref:`in-flight FFT<common-imu-fft>` is recommended (if your autopilot firmware includes this feature.. see: :ref:`Firmware Limitations<common-limited_firmware>` ).

ACRO Mode YAW Rate Controller
=============================

As of version 4.2, ArduPilot provides the option for utilization of a rate controller for YAW, which behaves in the same manner as the pitch and roll controllers, but for the YAW axis controlled by the Rudder stick, assuming the vehicle has a rudder control surface.

To enable this functionality, set :ref:`YAW_RATE_ENABLE<YAW_RATE_ENABLE>` to 1. When enabled, the :ref:`ACRO_YAW_RATE<ACRO_YAW_RATE>` parameter can be used to adjust maximum yaw rate demanded at rudder stick full deflections in ACRO mode.

This controller can be AutoTuned in the same manner as the pitch and roll axes, and in the same session using the Rudder control stick to produce the rapid yaw demands used by AUTOTUNE. Autotuning YAW can also be done in ACRO mode using an auxiliary switch set with the ``RCx_OPTION`` to 107. 

.. note:: while AutoTuning with this controller enabled, it will resist any non-pilot commanded yaw changes, (ie like traditional helicopter "heading hold" gyros), just as in ACRO mode with the yaw rate controller active. Banking the aircraft will NOT result in a turn, or at least a poorly executed turn. Pilot rudder inputs in turns will be needed.

Autotune Level 0
================

This is a special level that does not change the rates or time constant (ie like :ref:`RLL2SRV_RMAX<RLL2SRV_RMAX>` or :ref:`PTCH2SRV_TCONST<PTCH2SRV_TCONST>`) but tunes FF/P/I/D for the current values of those parameters. This may be useful when pitch is unstable at a lower :ref:`AUTOTUNE_LEVEL<AUTOTUNE_LEVEL>` level than roll, for example. You can set the ROLL axis values at more agressive values than the pitch axis and proceed with a tune to re-optimize the FF/P/I/D values for that configuration.


Completing the tune
===================

Once you have learned reasonable tuning parameters with
autotune you should complete the tune by manually tuning some other key
parameters.

The parameters that are needed for most airframes are:

:ref:`NAVL1_PERIOD<NAVL1_PERIOD>`: This defaults to 25, which is a very conservative value
designed to cope with badly tuned airframes. It controls how sharply the
aircraft will turn in automatic modes (such as AUTO, RTL and LOITER).
Most aircraft should use a significantly lower value. Once you have
completed a successful autotune of roll and pitch values you should drop
:ref:`NAVL1_PERIOD<NAVL1_PERIOD>` to 18 if you have not tuned it yet. To tune beyond that
level you should fly a rectangular mission in AUTO mode and adjust
:ref:`NAVL1_PERIOD<NAVL1_PERIOD>` down by 1 at a time until the aircraft turns at a rate you
are happy with, and does not "wag its tail" in flight.

:ref:`PTCH2SRV_RLL<PTCH2SRV_RLL>`: This parameter controls how much elevator to add in turns
to keep the nose level. Many aircraft require a small change to this
parameter from the default of 1.0. To see if you need to tune this value
you should hold a tight circle in FBWA mode by holding the aileron stick
hard over while not giving any elevator input. If the plane gains
altitude then you should lower :ref:`PTCH2SRV_RLL<PTCH2SRV_RLL>` by a small amount (try
lowering to 0.95 initially). If the plane loses altitude while circling
then try raising :ref:`PTCH2SRV_RLL<PTCH2SRV_RLL>` by a small amount (try 1.05 initially).
If you need to go above 1.3 or below 0.8 then there is probably a
problem with your setup (such as incorrect center of gravity, poor
thrust line, poor airspeed calibration, too soft a tune on the pitch
loop, or bad compass errors). You should try and fix the setup.

There are many other parameters which can improve the performance of
your aircraft, but these are the ones that most people need. Please read
the normal manual tuning documentation for more information.

AUTOTUNE Logging
================

The progress of the autotune is recorded in the dataflash log. If you
are trying to debug autotune or are posting about autotune on the forums
then please include the dataflash log.

Here is a typical log file from an autotune session:

.. image:: ../images/autotune.jpg
    :target: ../_images/autotune.jpg

The ATRP message has a "Type" field that shows what type of autotune is
being recorded. A Type value of 0 is for roll tuning, and a value of 1
is for pitch tuning. When graphing ATRP results you should choose data
with a Type of either 0 or 1 (not both).

The ATRP.Demanded field is the demanded rate of attitude change (roll
rate or pitch rate) in degrees per second. The ATRP.Achieved field is
what the aircraft actually achieved in attitude change rate. As you can
see in the above graph, at the start of the autotune the demanded values
were much higher than the achieved, because the tuning gains were too
low. As the tune progressed the demanded and achieved started to
converge. The blue line in the above graph is the ATRP.P value, which is
the P gain for the controller. You can see it rose from 0.8 up to a high
of 2.2, then dropped back slightly to around 1.85.

You will also notice that the graph has gaps in it. This is for periods
where the pilot was not demanding a high rate of attitude change. The
autotune system only works while the pilot is demanding a rapid attitude
change (above 80% of the maximum rate).

Manual tuning versus AUTOTUNE
=============================

For the very best performance with Plane you can perform a manual
tune, perhaps starting with the values from Autotune. The Autotune
system is designed as a conservative system to get reasonable values for
most aircraft, it is not a "perfect tuner", and manual tuning can result
in better performance if you put the time and effort in. But it requires using
and analyzing log file results. 

It is still recommended that everyone start out with AUTOTUNE however.
Correctly tuning an aircraft is not easy, and AUTOTUNE does better than
the vast majority of users can do. So start with an AUTOTUNE and then
explore the manual tuning guide starting from what AUTOTUNE produces if
you want to push things further.

Manually increasing the D gain can improve the accuracy of the roll and
pitch response and make the plane less affected by gusts and turbulence.
The optimum value for D gain for a high performance tune can be found by
increasing the gain in small increments until the aircraft starts to
oscillate. The gain should then be halved from the value that caused it
to oscillate. The oscillations that are generated using this method can
be large, so do not perform this step unless you are prepared to take
manual control. It is recommended that D gain tuning is performed at
lower throttle settings and airspeeds.

If you adjust the I gain manually, then this also changes the value for
P that is required to maintain the correct response, so adjusting the I
gain is only recommended for advanced users.
