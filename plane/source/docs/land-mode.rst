LAND Mode
=========

Auto Land is set by the mission control scripting only. Throttle and
altitude is controlled by the autopilot. After getting closer
``LAND_FLARE_ALT`` meters from the target altitude or ``LAND_FLARE_SEC``
seconds from the target landing point the plane will "flare" to the
``LAND_PITCH_CD`` pitch (in centidegrees) and will hold heading for the
final approach.

Setting up Plane for reliable auto-takeoff and landing is very airframe
dependent, and it is recommended that you first get some experience
flying your aircraft in FBWA mode, and be ready to take over control in
manual or FBWA mode the first few times you use an automatic takeoff or
landing.

You should also look through the complete list of parameters, as there
are a lot of parameters that help control takeoff and landing for
different situations.
