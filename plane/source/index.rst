The free Plane firmware running on a compatible controller board gives
any fixed-wing aircraft full autonomous capability. VTOL fixed-wing aircraft that 
hover and cruise in different configurations 
are also included under the arduplane firmware.

Plane provides advanced functions such as support for hundreds of
three-dimensional waypoints, automatic take-off and landing as well as
sophisticated mission planning and camera controls.
It works with a variety of :ref:`Ground Control Station <common-choosing-a-ground-station>` (GCS) software for
programming and mission operations and offers a complete UAV solution.

The entire package is designed to be easily approachable for the novice,
while remaining open-ended for custom applications, education, and
research use.

.. note::

    This is the platform that won the prestigious 
    `Outback Challenge UAV competition <http://uavchallenge.org>`__ 
    in `2012 <https://diydrones.com/profiles/blogs/canberrauav-outback-challenge-2012-debrief>`__,
    `2014 <https://diydrones.com/profiles/blogs/canberrauav-outback-challenge-2014-debrief>`__
    and `2016 <https://discuss.ardupilot.org/t/canberrauav-outback-challenge-2016-debrief/12162>`__ as well as the \
    `2014 Sparkfun Autonomous Vehicle Competition <https://avc.sparkfun.com/2014/scores#Aerial:Fixed>`__.

System components
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  :ref:`Autopilot <common-autopilots>` loaded with the latest
   version of `Plane firmware <http://firmware.ardupilot.org/>`__
-  :ref:`Ground Control Station <common-choosing-a-ground-station>`
   with software that gives you an easy point-and-click setup/configuration, along
   with a full-featured interface.
-  A suitable airframe, transmitter, and receiver for your mission.
-  Support tools and hardware for operating and maintaining your
   aircraft.
-  Many other useful options, such as :ref:`two-way telemetry radios <common-telemetry-landingpage>` which allow in-flight
   communication and control between the aircraft and your computer.

Fixed-wing aircraft
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A fixed-wing aircraft has both advantages and disadvantages in
comparison with rotor-craft. Fixed-wing aircraft tend to be more
forgiving in the air in the face of both piloting and technical errors,
as they have natural gliding capabilities with no power.  Fixed-wing
aircraft also are able to carry greater payloads for longer distances on
less power.

There is a huge variety of fixed wing aircraft from electric battery
powered small foam planes to large scale wooden replicas with multi
liquid fuel engines and everything in between.  You are bound to find a
plane that suits your flying style and needs. With the advance of VTOL 
fixed-wing aircraft, taking off and landing in tight spaces is now possible too.

When precision missions are required, fixed-wing aircraft are at a
disadvantage, as they must have air moving over their wings to generate
lift.  This means they must stay in forward motion, which means they
can't hover in one spot the way a copter can and as a result cannot
provide the same level of precise camera positioning.

For longer missions and more payload, a fixed-wing is your best
choice. But for keeping a camera in one place or moving slowly, consider 
switching to a copter instead. The same APM autopilot can control that 
equally well by simply loading the :ref:`Copter <copter:home>` code.
