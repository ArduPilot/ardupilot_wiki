User Alerts
===========

A User Alert is a formal report of an ArduPilot issue that may affect the safe operation of a vehicle.

All ArduPilot users are strongly encouraged to regularly check this page for any User Alerts that may affect their vehicles.

User Alerts will only be for ArduPilot software issues. Manufacturer hardware will not be included at this stage, although this may be reviewed at a later date.

The User Alert documentation is available on the :ref:`developer wiki <dev:user-alerts-developer>`.

For more information about a specific User Alert, see the `User Alert
Database <https://firmware.ardupilot.org/userAlerts/alerts.html>`_.

   All User Alerts reported from 16/09/2020 (or later) are in the User Alert database. There is no guarantee
   that the database holds all User Alerts reported before this date.
