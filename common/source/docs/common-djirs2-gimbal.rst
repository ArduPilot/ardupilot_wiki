DJI RS2 and RS3-Pro Gimbals
===========================

ArduPilot 4.4 (and higher) support the `DJI RS2 <https://www.dji.com/rs-2>`__ and `DJI RS3-Pro <https://www.dji.com/jp/rs-3-pro>`__ handheld gimbals using a :ref:`Lua script <common-lua-scripts>`.  The driver relies on the gimbal supporting the "DJI R SDK" protocol which is only these two gimbals as far as we know.  Other gimbals including the very similar RSC2 and RS3 are not supported.

What to Buy
===========

- `DJI RS2 <https://www.dji.com/rs-2>`__ or `DJI RS3-Pro <https://www.dji.com/jp/rs-3-pro>`__ gimbal
- `DJI R Focus Wheel <https://store.dji.com/product/ronin-s-focus-wheel>`__ to allow connecting to the autopilot

Connection and Configuration
============================

Connect the autopilot's CAN1 or CAN2 port to the Focus wheel as shown below

Connect to the autopilot with a ground station and do the following

- If using CAN1, set :ref:`CAN_D1_PROTOCOL <CAN_D1_PROTOCOL>` = 10 (Scripting), :ref:`CAN_P1_DRIVER <CAN_P1_DRIVER>` = 1 (First driver)
- If using CAN2, set :ref:`CAN_D2_PROTOCOL <CAN_D2_PROTOCOL>` = 10 (Scripting), :ref:`CAN_P2_DRIVER <CAN_P2_DRIVER>` = 2 (Second driver)
- Set :ref:`SCR_ENABLE <SCR_ENABLE>` = 1 to enable scripting
- Set :ref:`SCR_HEAP_SIZE <SCR_HEAP_SIZE>` = 120000 (or higher)
- Set :ref:`MNT1_TYPE <MNT1_TYPE>` = 9 (Scripting) to enable the mount/gimbal scripting driver
- Reboot the autopilot
- Download mount-djirs2-driver.lua (`from here <https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot/tree/master/libraries/AP_Scripting/drivers>`__) and copy it to the autopilot's SD card in the APM/scripts directory and reboot the autopilot
- Optionally set DJIR_DEBUG to 1 to display parsing and errors stats at 5sec.  Set to 2 to display gimbal angles

Testing
=======

See :ref:`Gimbal / Mount Controls <common-mount-targeting>` for details on how to control the gimbal
