===============================

The `Avionics Anonymous Magnetometer <https://docs.avionicsanonymous.com/devices/minimag>`__ is a high-performance
magnetometer for small unmanned vehicles. It includes a high-quality Memsic MMC5983MA magnetometer enabling 
better than 1-degree heading accuracy. The device interfaces to your autopilot via a robust `DroneCAN <https://dronecan.org>`__ 
interface, which provides high reliability connections to peripherals over greater distances than I2C.
