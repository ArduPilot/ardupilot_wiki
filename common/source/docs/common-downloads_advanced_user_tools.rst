DATE POSTED	April 29, 2013



– New interrupt system that handles certain Futaba receivers better
(simultaneous changes on groups of R/C channels in fast intervals)
– Adapted behaviour in case of channel loss:

  - ch1, roll: set to center (1500us)
  - ch2, pitch: set to center (1500us)
  - ch3, throttle: set to low (900us)
  - ch4, yaw: set to center (1500us)
  - ch5-ch8: retain last value


APM 2.x LED STATUS:
+++++++++++++++++++

* - RX – OFF = No input signal detected
* - RX – SLOW TOGGLE = Input signal OK
* - RX – FAST TOGGLE = Invalid input signal(s) detected
* - RX – ON = Input signal(s) lost during flight and fail-safe activated
* - TX – OFF= PPM output disabled
* - TX – FAST TOGGLE = PPM output enabled
* - TX – SLOW TOGGLE = PPM pass-trough mode

SERVO INPUT (PWM) MODE:
+++++++++++++++++++++++

* – PPM output will not be enabled unless a input signal has been detected and verified
* – Verified inputs are lost during operation (lose servo wire or receiver malfunction):
* + The last known value of the lost input channel is kept for ~1 second
* + If the lost input channel is not restored within ~1 second, it will be set to the default fail-safe value (for channel 1-4) or kept at the last value (for channel 5-8)
* – Lost channel signal is restored:
* + Normal channel operation is restored using the valid input signal

PPM PASS-THROUGH MODE (signal pin 2&3 shorted):
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

* – PPM output will not be enabled unless a input signal has been detected
* – Active signal on input channel 1 has been detected:
* + Any input level changes will be passed directly to the PPM output (PPM pass-trough)
* + If no input level changes are detected within 250ms:
* + PPM output is enabled and default fail-safe values for all eight channels transmitted
* + Input level change detected again, PPM fail-safe output is terminated and normal PPM pass-through operation is restored

DATE POSTED	April 29, 2013

.. warning::

    Do not use with APM 2.x

For ArduCopter it is better to use the dedicated version so that CH8 can be fully used without risk to trig radio passthrough mode.

Changes:
++++++++

– New interrupt system that handles certain Futaba receivers better
(simultaneous changes on groups of R/C channels in fast intervals)

– Adapted behaviour in case of channel loss:

ch1, roll: set to center (1500μs)
ch2, pitch: set to center (1500μs)
ch3, throttle: set to low (900μs)
ch4, yaw: set to center (1500μs)

ch5-ch8: retain last value


LED STATUS:
+++++++++++

Normal mode:

– Error condition (All channels lost or throttle channel lost): blue LED blinks very fast
– Normal behaviour: blue LED blinks according to throttle position

Radio Passthrough mode (for ArduPlane only):

– If throttle position < 1200 μs, status LED is off 
- If throttle position > 1200 μs, status LED is on

Safety
======

Operating a powered vehicle of any kind can be a lot of fun. 
However, nothing will ruin your day at the park more quickly than an accident or running afoul of the law. 
Since we want you to have a great experience, please make sure that you do all of the following:

* Operate within all local laws and regulations. 
  For example, in the United States, current regulations require you to operate most UAVs under 400 
  foot above ground level, within line of site, and away from obstructions and populated areas. 
  Since these regulations vary from place to place, even within the same country, ensure that 
  you understand what you need to do to stay compliant.
* Never operate the vehicle or software in a way that could be dangerous to you, other people, or property. 
  Propellers, while rotating, could easily cut you; if a UAV fell on a person or object, 
  it could cause injury; a UAV caught in power lines could cause an outage. 
  As Ben Franklin said, “An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.”
* Always keep in mind that software and hardware failures happen. 
  Although we design our products to minimize such issues, you should always operate with the understanding that 
  a failure could occur at any point of time and without warning. 
  As such, you should take the appropriate precautions to minimize danger in case of failure.
* Never use the software or hardware for manned vehicles. 
  The software and hardware we provide is only for use in unmanned vehicles.
