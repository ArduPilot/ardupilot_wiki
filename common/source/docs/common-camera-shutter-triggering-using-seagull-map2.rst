   Seagull #MAP2 from Seagull UAV

Overview
========

ArduPilot allows you to :ref:`configure a servo or relay output as the control signal for the camera shutter <common-camera-shutter-with-servo>` so that it can be used in
:ref:`Camera Missions <common-camera-control-and-auto-missions-in-mission-planner>`.
Additional hardware is required to convert the shutter activation signal
to the format expected by the particular camera.

The `Seagull #MAP2 <http://www.seagulluav.com/product/seagull-map2/>`__
provides everything needed to connect a Pixhawk to a :ref:`supported camera listed on Seagull UAV's Cable Finder page <https://www.seagulluav.com/map-cable-finder/>` in order to automate
camera shutter triggering.

The board supports two trigger modes: 
**AF-T** ("AutoFocus-Trigger" with 1 second pre-focus followed by trigger) 
**IS-T** ("Instant-Trigger", instant trigger as soon as camera locks focus)
The mode used is determined by the servo PWM
output set in the :ref:`Camera Shutter Configuration <common-camera-shutter-with-servo>` in Mission Planner.

Seagull #MAP2 also supports "Camera ON/OFF" which is **exclusive to Sony "Multi" cameras!**
This feature can be used in missions by adding the commands
"Do-Set-Servo" or "Do-Repeat-Servo" in Mission Planner.

This article provides a brief overview of how to set up the board. More
detailed instructions are provided in the `Seagull #MAP2 Manual <https://www.seagulluav.com/manuals/Seagull_MAP2-Manual.pdf>`__
and the `Seagull #MAP2 product support page <https://www.seagulluav.com/seagull-map2-support//>`__.

.. note::

   The board also supports triggering from the RC transmitter (this
   is not covered in this article, but is demonstrated in the manual).

Parts and hardware connections
==============================

The Seagull #MAP can be `purchased from Seagull UAV <http://www.seagulluav.com/product/seagull-map2/>`__ and comes with a
servo cable included. The camera cables has to be purchased separately - please use the `**Cable Finder** <https://www.seagulluav.com/map-cable-finder/>` page to determine which cable is needed.

Below is a list of the cables offered by Seagull UAV:

-  Canon: E3, N3
-  Sony: Minolta S1, S2 (Multi-Angled), S2 (Multi-Straight)
-  Nikon: DC0, DC2
-  Olympus: UC1, E-system
-  Panasonic: RS1
-  Samsung: NX
-  Fujifilm: RR-80, RR-90
-  Sigma: CR-31
-  Apple: IOS

Working out the correct connections is easy; the left hand side is for
the servo connector to the Pixhawk while the right hand side has a 2.5mm
jack for connecting the cable for your specific camera. You can connect
to any of Pixhawk's usable AUX ports, as discussed in :ref:`Camera Shutter Configuration in Mission Planner <common-camera-shutter-with-servo>`.

.. note::

   #MAP2 is powered by Pixhawk's power rail ( the middle pin + ).
   Ensure that the rail is powered by BEC or other power source ranging
   from 3.5-5.5 Volts in order for #MAP to function properly.

Camera shutter configuration in Mission Planner
===============================================

The :ref:`Camera Shutter Configuration in Mission Planner <common-camera-shutter-with-servo>` article explains how to
configure Pixhawk AUX output as a servo camera trigger.

The parameters used to configure this particular hardware are listed
below. Note that you have to set different shutter pushed and duration
values depending on which mode you want to support for camera
triggering.

-  ``CAM_TRIG_TYPE``: 0 (Servo).
-  ``Shutter (Port)``: Depends on the connected output - e.g. RC10 for
   AUX2.
-  ``Shutter Pushed``:

   -  ``AF-T``: 1300 μS (1200 to 1400 μS).
   -  ``IS-T``: 1700 μS (1600 to 1800 μS).

-  ``Shutter Not Pushed``: 1500us (1400 to 1600 μS).
-  ``Shutter Duration``: Set the value **"1"** for AF-T mode or **"10"** for
   IS-T mode.

Troubleshooting
===============

To determine what state *Seagull #MAP* is currently in - simply read the
output of the "STATE LED" and match it with the "Action" in the table
below.

   #MAP: STATE LED

The following table shows the STATE LED readout for the different states
/ modes.
