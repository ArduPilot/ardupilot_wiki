Rangefinders (landing page)
===========================

Copter/Plane/Rover support a number of different rangefinders including
Maxbotix Sonar and Pulsed Light LED range finders.

.. tip::

   If you get a "Bad LiDAR Health" message in *Mission Planner* this
   is caused because the rangefinder isn't enabled for landing.  This is
   done through the ``RNGFND_LANDING`` parameter and if set you should see
   the message disappear.

.. note::

   Lidar's are used in flight modes which have height control, such
   as Altitude Hold, Loiter and PosHold Mode.  The data from the sensor
   will be used until you exceed RNGFND_MAX_CM, after that it switches to
   the barometer.  Copter-3.4 includes support for :ref:`Terrain Following <terrain-following>` in Auto mode.
