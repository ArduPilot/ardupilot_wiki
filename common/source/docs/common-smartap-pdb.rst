Sky-Drones SmartAP Power Distribution Board
===========================================

Overview
========

`SmartAP PDB <https://sky-drones.com/power/smartap-pdb.html>`__ (Power Distribution Board) is a board which allows transferring the power from 
the battery to ESCs / Motors and generate power supply for the flight controller and 
other peripherals with different voltage levels. Also, PDB provides the functionality for battery 
voltage / current measurements. SmartAP PDB makes high-power lines connections easier and much more reliable.

Pinouts
=======

SmartAP Power Distribution Board pinout diagram is shown below. Big pads in the rear side are intended for the main battery connection. Up to four independent batteries can be connected using the thick wires (e.g. 8-10 AWG) to be able to handle high current loads and even more using thinner wires. Both top and bottom, left and right sides have pads for ESCs power supply connection. Therefore, up to 12 ESCs can be connected.

Voltage and current sensors
===========================

SmartAP PDB has integrated voltage and current sensors. Current sensor is located on the bottom side of the PDB. For correct scale / offset configuration, please, refer to Configuration section.
