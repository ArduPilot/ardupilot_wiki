.. note::

   Support for these two boards are available with Copter-3.6.0 (and higher)

.. note::

	Due to flash memory limitations, this board does not include all ArduPilot features.
        See :ref:`Firmware Limitations <common-limited_firmware>` for details.

Pinout
======

The KakuteF7 comes in two variants with the primary difference being the AIO (All-In-One) board employs current sensor and provides power distribution in each of the four corners.
Both variants include a 5-volt regulator rated for 2 amps, OSD, vibration-isolated IMU, etc.

UART Mapping
============

The UARTs are marked Rn and Tn in the above pinouts. The Rn pin is the
receive pin for UARTn. The Tn pin is the transmit pin for UARTn.

   -  SERIAL0 -> USB
   -  SERIAL1 -> UART1 (Telem1)
   -  SERIAL2 -> UART2 (Telem2)
   -  SERIAL3 -> UART3 (GPS)
   -  SERIAL4 -> UART4
   -  SERIAL5 -> UART7
   -  SERIAL6 -> UART6 (TX only unless :ref:`BRD_ALT_CONFIG<BRD_ALT_CONFIG>` = 1, then RX available also)

The SERIAL5 port (UART7) is normally for ESC telemetry, and has an R7 pad on
each of the four corners of the KakuteF7 AIO board.


Servo Output Mapping
====================

The PWM outputs are marked M1-M6 in the above pinouts. The corresponding servo outputs are:

    - M1 -> Servo Output 4
    - M2 -> Servo Output 1
    - M3 -> Servo Output 2
    - M4 -> Servo Output 3
    - M5 -> Servo Output 5
    - M6 -> Servo Output 6

RC Input
========

The R6 pin, which by default is mapped to a timer input, can be used for all ArduPilot supported receiver protocols, except CRSF which requires a true UART connection. However, bi-directional protocols which include telemetry, such as SRXL2 and FPort, when connected in this manner, will only provide RC without telemetry. 

To allow CRSF and embedded telemetry available in Fport, CRSF, and SRXL2 receivers, the R6 pin can also be configured to be used as true UART RX pin for use with bi-directional systems by setting the :ref:`BRD_ALT_CONFIG<BRD_ALT_CONFIG>` to “1” so it becomes the SERIAL6 port's RX input pin.

With this option, :ref:`SERIAL6_PROTOCOL<SERIAL6_PROTOCOL>` must be set to "23", and:

- PPM is not supported.

- SBUS/DSM/SRXL connects to the R6 pin, but SBUS requires that the :ref:`SERIAL6_OPTIONS<SERIAL6_OPTIONS>` be set to "3".

- FPort requires connection to T6 and :ref:`SERIAL6_OPTIONS<SERIAL6_OPTIONS>` be set to "7".

- CRSF also requires a T6 connection, in addition to R6, and automatically provides telemetry. Set :ref:`SERIAL6_OPTIONS<SERIAL6_OPTIONS>` to "0".

- SRXL2 requires a connection to T6 and automatically provides telemetry.  Set :ref:`SERIAL6_OPTIONS<SERIAL6_OPTIONS>` to "4".

Any UART can be used for RC system connections in ArduPilot also, and is compatible with all protocols except PPM. See :ref:`common-rc-systems` for details.

FrSky Telemetry
===============
 
FrSky Telemetry is supported using the T6 pin (UART6 transmit). You need to set the following parameters to enable support for FrSky S.PORT
 
  - :ref:`SERIAL6_PROTOCOL<SERIAL6_PROTOCOL>` 10
  - :ref:`SERIAL6_OPTIONS<SERIAL6_OPTIONS>` 7
  
OSD Support
===========

The KakuteF7 AIO supports OSD using :ref:`OSD_TYPE<OSD_TYPE>` 1 (MAX7456 driver).

PWM Output
==========

The KakuteF7 supports up to 6 PWM outputs. The pads for motor output M1 to M6 on the above diagram are for the 6 outputs. All 6 outputs support DShot as well as all PWM types.

The PWM is in 3 groups:

 - PWM 1, 2 and 3 in group1
 - PWM 4 and 5 in group2
 - PWM 6 in group3

Channels within the same group need to use the same output rate, whether PWM or Dshot. If
any channel in a group uses DShot then all channels in the group need
to use DShot.

Battery Monitoring
==================

The AIO board has a built-in current sensor. The current
sensor can read up to 130 Amps. The voltage sensor can handle up to 6S
LiPo batteries.

The correct battery setting parameters are:

 - :ref:`BATT_MONITOR<BATT_MONITOR>` 4
 - :ref:`BATT_VOLT_PIN<BATT_VOLT_PIN>` 13
 - :ref:`BATT_CURR_PIN<BATT_CURR_PIN>` 12
 - :ref:`BATT_VOLT_MULT<BATT_VOLT_MULT>` 10.1
 - :ref:`BATT_AMP_PERVLT<BATT_AMP_PERVLT>` 17.0

Compass
=======

The Kakute F7 and Kakute F7 AIO do not have a built-in compass, however you can attach an external compass using I2C on the SDA and SCL pads.

Loading Firmware
================

Initial firmware load can be done with DFU by plugging in USB with the
bootloader button pressed. Then you should load the "with_bl.hex"
firmware, using your favourite DFU loading tool.

Once the initial firmware is loaded you can update the firmware using
any ArduPilot ground station software. Updates should be done with the
\*.apj firmware files.
