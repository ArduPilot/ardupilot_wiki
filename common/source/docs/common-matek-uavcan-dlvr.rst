Matek DroneCAN DLVR-10 Airspeed Sensor
======================================

The Matek ASPD-DLVR is a DLVR-10 sensor with a CAN/DroneCAN or I2C interface. The DLVR airspeed sensors are the highest precision, lowest temperature drift sensors currently supported in ArduPilot. It can also be used to attach a GPS and/or Compass and present them to the autopilot as DroneCAN peripherals.

I2C Port to Autopilot for use in place of CAN (enabled by unsoldering two zero ohm resistors, see diagram below.)

.. note:: Solder pad I2C bus on rear is for attaching an external compass when this port is NOT enabled, and it will be presented to the AutoPilot as a DroneCAN compass.

Setup
=====

DroneCAN Mode
-------------
Verify the following parameters are set on your autopilot via your ground station.

- :ref:`CAN_P1_DRIVER<CAN_P1_DRIVER>` = 1 (assuming its on the first CAN bus of the autopilot)
- :ref:`ARSPD_TYPE<ARSPD_TYPE>` = 8 (DroneCAN)

if optional GPS is connected to UART2, then set

- :ref:`GPS_TYPE<GPS_TYPE>` = 9 (DroneCAN) or if it will be the secondary GPS, set instead
- :ref:`GPS_TYPE2<GPS_TYPE2>` = 9 (DroneCAN)



- Reboot

Make sure the DroneCAN compass driver is not disabled if an optional external Compass is connected to the rear I2C pads:. (:ref:`COMPASS_TYPEMASK<COMPASS_TYPEMASK>` bit 9 should not be set). 


I2C Mode
--------

- :ref:`ARSPD_TYPE<ARSPD_TYPE>` = 9 (DLVR-10)
- :ref:`ARSPD_USE<ARSPD_USE>` = 1 to enable using the sensor on autopilots external I2C bus

.. note:: if your autopilot has more than one I2C bus or presents its internal bus externally, may need to set :ref:`ARSPD_BUS<ARSPD_BUS>` for the one you connect to on the autopilot.

Firmware Update
---------------

Firmware may be updated in the future to include the option of MSP connectivity. See `here <http://www.mateksys.com/?portfolio=aspd-dlvr#tab-id-4>`_  for instructions for using the firmware update UART1 pads, or if using DroneCAN, see instructions :ref:`here <common-mp-slcan>`
