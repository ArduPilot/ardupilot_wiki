Non-GPS Navigation

These are the available options that allow a vehicle to estimate its position without a GPS.  Once enabled this allows all autonomous and semi-autonomous modes just as they do would a GPS is available.

.. note::

   The low cost IMUs (accelerometers, gyros, compass) used in most autopilots drift too quickly to allow position estimation without an external velocity or position source.  In other words, low-cost IMUs on their own are not sufficient for estimating position.
   
.. note::

   A board with more than 1MB of flash is required to run non-GPS navigation, except for Vicon as 1MB boards still support the GPS_INPUT message, although they don't support the GLOBAL_VISION_POSITION_ESTIMATE so they have to be run using the GPS_INPUT message. See :ref:`Firmware Limitations <common-limited_firmware>` for details.
