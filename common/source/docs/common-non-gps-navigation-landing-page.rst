These are the available options that allow a vehicle to estimate its position without a GPS.  Once enabled this allows all autonomous and semi-autonomous modes just as they do would a GPS is available.

.. note::

   The low cost IMUs (accelerometers, gyros, compass) used in most autopilots drift too quickly to allow position estimation without an external velocity or position source.  In other words, low-cost IMUs on their own are not sufficient for estimating position
   
.. note::

   A board with more than 1MB of flash is required to run non-GPS navigation. See :ref:`Firmware Limitations <common-limited_firmware>` for details
