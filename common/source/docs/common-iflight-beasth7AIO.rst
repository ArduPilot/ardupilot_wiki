Where to Buy
============

Default UART order
==================

he UARTs are marked Rn and Tn in the above pinouts. The Rn pin is the receive pin for UARTn. The Tn pin is the transmit pin for UARTn.

- SERIAL0 = console = USB
- SERIAL1 = Telemetry1 = USART1 (Alternate RC input/output)
- SERIAL2 = Telemetry2 = USART2 (DJI)
- SERIAL3 = RC Input = USART3 
- SERIAL4 = GPS = USART4
- SERIAL7 = USER = UART7 

UART1 supports RX and TX DMA. UART2, UART3 and UART4 support RX DMA. UART7 supports TX DMA

RC Input
========

RC input is configured by default via the USART3 RX input. It supports all RC protocols except PPM. FPort and full duplex protocols will need to use instead,both RX1 and TX1.

.. note:: If the receiver is FPort or a full duplex protocol, then the receiver must be tied to the USART1 TX pin and :ref:`SERIAL1_OPTIONS<SERIAL1_OPTIONS>` = 7 (invert TX/RX, half duplex), :ref:`SERIAL1_PROTOCOL<SERIAL1_PROTOCOL>` set to 23, and :ref:`RSSI_TYPE<RSSI_TYPE>` =3.


Dshot Capability
================

All motor 1-4 outputs are bi-directional Dshot and PWM capable. However, mixing Dshot and normal PWM operation for outputs is restricted into groups, ie. enabling Dshot for an output in a group requires that ALL outputs in that group be configured and used as Dshot, rather than PWM outputs. The output groups that must be the same (PWM rate or Dshot, when configured as a normal servo/motor output) are: 1/4, and 2/3.

Neopixel Output
===============

The LED pin is PWM output 5 and is default setup for use with a NeoPixel 4 led string for notifications.

Battery Monitor
===============

The board has a built-in voltage and current sensors.

The correct battery monitor parameters are:

-    :ref:`BATT_MONITOR<BATT_MONITOR>` =  4
-    :ref:`BATT_VOLT_PIN<BATT_VOLT_PIN>` = 12
-    :ref:`BATT_VOLT_MULT<BATT_VOLT_MULT>` ~ 10.9
-    :ref:`BATT_CURR_PIN<BATT_CURR_PIN>` = 13
-    :ref:`BATT_AMP_PERVLT<BATT_AMP_PERVLT>` ~ 100

These are set by default in the firmware.

Flashing Firmware
=================

Usually these boards are sold pre-flashed with Betaflight firmware and require both firmware and bootloader to be updated if you want to use ArduPilot. See :ref:`common-loading-firmware-onto-chibios-only-boards`.
