============================

This articles describes how to setup and use three features supported
by recent BLHeli ESC firmwares.

- DShot ESC protocol support
- ESC telemetry support
- BLHeli pass-thru configuration and ESC flashing

Detailed descriptions of these features are lower down on this page.

.. warning::

   As of April 2018 these features are currently only available with Copter-3.6 and Plane-3.9 using the ChibiOS firmware for STM32 based flight boards, and not yet a stable release.
   Please join the http://gitter.im/ArduPilot/ChibiOS gitter channel for up to date information on these builds.
   Only try DShot on ESCs that are known to support it or you will get unpredictable results.

Where to buy
============

`blheli32.com provides this list of BLHeli compatible ESCs <http://www.blheli32.com/list-of-blheli_32-escs/>`__.
We recommend choosing one that has the telemetry wire pre-soldered (see blue wire below).

Connecting and Configuring
===========================

    :width: 600px

For :ref:`Pixhawk <common-pixhawk-overview>` and :ref:`Pixhawk2 <common-pixhawk2-overview>` boards the ESC's ground and signal wire should be connected to the AUX OUT ports.
For :ref:`Pixracer <common-pixracer-overview>` and :ref:`other boards <common-autopilots>` the normal outputs can be used.

Connect all ESC's telemetry wires to a single Telemetry RX pin on the flight board (above diagram uses Serial5).

To enable DShot:

- :ref:`MOT_PWM_TYPE <MOT_PWM_TYPE>` (or :ref:`Q_M_PWM_TYPE <Q_M_PWM_TYPE>` on quadplanes) to **4** meaning "DShot150"
- on Pixhawk and Pixhawk2 boards:

  - set :ref:`SERVO1_FUNCTION <SERVO1_FUNCTION>` to :ref:`SERVO4_FUNCTION <SERVO4_FUNCTION>` to 0
  - set :ref:`SERVO9_FUNCTION <SERVO9_FUNCTION>` to :ref:`SERVO12_FUNCTION <SERVO12_FUNCTION>` to 33, 34, 35, 36 respectively
  - for hexacopters, set :ref:`BRD_PWM_COUNT <BRD_PWM_COUNT>` to 6, :ref:`SERVO1_FUNCTION <SERVO5_FUNCTION>` and :ref:`SERVO6_FUNCTION <SERVO6_FUNCTION>` to 0, :ref:`SERVO13_FUNCTION <SERVO13_FUNCTION>` and :ref:`SERVO14_FUNCTION <SERVO14_FUNCTION>` to 37, 38 respectively

To enable ESC telemetry:

- :ref:`SERIAL5_PROTOCOL <SERIAL5_PROTOCOL>` = 16 (if telemetry is connected to Serial5)
- :ref:`SERVO_BLH_TRATE <SERVO_BLH_TRATE>` to 10 to enable 10hz updates from the ESC

DShot Protocol
==============

The DShot ESC protocol is a digital protocol for communication between
a flight board and an ESC. The key advantages are:

- all values sent to the ESC are protected with a 4 bit CRC
- clock differences between the ESC and flight controller don't affect
  flight
- no need to do any ESC throttle range calibration
- very high protocol frame frames are supported

The DShot protocol can run at several different speeds. ArduPilot
supports four speeds:

- DShot150 at 150kbaud (recommended)
- DShot300 at 300kbaud
- DShot600 at 600kbaud
- DShot1200 at 1200kbaud

We recommend using the lowest baud rate, DShot150,
as it is the most reliable protocol (lower baudrates are less
susceptible to noise on cables).  Higher values will be beneficial
once ArduPilot's main loop rate is capable of speeds above 1kHz.

The protocol ArduPilot uses is controlled by setting the 
:ref:`MOT_PWM_TYPE <MOT_PWM_TYPE>` (or :ref:`Q_M_PWM_TYPE <Q_M_PWM_TYPE>` on quadplanes) to a value from 4 to 7.
The value of 4 corresponds to DShot150.

DShot sends 16 bits per frame, with bits allocated as follows:

- 11 bits for the throttle level
- 1 bit for telemetry request
- 4 bits for CRC (simple XOR)

This gives a good throttle resolution, with support for asking the ESC
to provide telemetry feedback. See below for more information on ESC
telemetry.

We do not currently support DShot output on other vehicle types.

.. note::

   DShot output is currently only supported on the "FMU" outputs of
   your flight controller. If you have a board with an IO
   microcontroller, with separate "main" and "auxillary" outputs, such
   as a Pixhawk1 or Pixhawk2/Cube, then you can only use DShot on the
   "auxillary" outputs. You will need to use the SERVOn_FUNCTION
   parameters to remap your motors to the auxillary outputs.

ESC Telemetry
=============

If using BLHeli_32, you can also enable ESC telemetry feedback, allowing you to log the
following variables from each ESC in flight:

- RPM
- Voltage
- current
- temperature
- total-current

To use ESC telemetry you need to connect a separate telemetry pin on
all your ESCs back to a single UART RX pin on your flight board. ESC
telemetry is currently only available with BLHeli_32 ESCs, and a wire for the
telemetry is only pre-soldered for some ESCs. If the wire isn't
pre-soldered you will need to solder it yourself.  
Support for KISS ESC Telemetry is planned.

The wires from all ESCs should all come back to a single UART RX
line. The way it works is that the flight board requests telemetry
from only one ESC at a time, cycling between them.

You can use any of the UARTs on your flight board for telemetry
feedback. You need to enable it using the SERIALn_PROTOCOL option for
the UART you are using. For example, on a PH2.1 if you wanted to use
the Serial5 UART you would set :ref:`SERIAL5_PROTOCOL <SERIAL5_PROTOCOL>` = 16 (where 16 is the
value for "ESC Telemetry").

You also need to set the telemetry rate in the :ref:`SERVO_BLH_TRATE <SERVO_BLH_TRATE>`
parameter. This rate is the rate in Hz per ESC. So if you set it to 10
then you will get 10Hz data for all ESCs.

The data is logged in the ESCn log messages in your dataflash
log. This can be viewed in any ArduPilot dataflash log viewer.

BLHeli Pass-Through Support
===========================

BLHeli pass-through support is a feature that allows you to configure
and upgrade the firmware on your ESCs without having to disconnect
them from your vehicle. You can plug a USB cable into your flight
controller and run the BLHeliSuite software for Windows to configure
your ESCs.

Note that you do not have to be using DShot to take advantage of
BLHeli pass-through support, although it is recommended that you do.

To enable BLHeli pass-through support you need to set one of two
variables:

- :ref:`SERVO_BLH_AUTO <SERVO_BLH_AUTO>` = 1 to enable automatic mapping of motors to
  BLHeliSuite ESC numbers.  for most users this will do the right thing.
- :ref:`SERVO_BLH_MASK <SERVO_BLH_MASK>` if you want to instead specify a specific set of
  servo outputs to enable.  For more complex setups where you want to choose exactly which servo outputs you want to configure

Once you have enabled BLHeli support with one of the above two
parameters you should reboot your flight board.

Now connect a USB cable to your flight board and use BLHeliSuite on
Windows to connect. You will need to use BLHeliSuite32 for BLHeli_32
ESCs, and BLHeliSuite16 for BLHeli/BLHeli_S ESCs.
