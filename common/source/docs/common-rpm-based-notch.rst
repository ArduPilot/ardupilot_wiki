RPM Sensor Based Dynamic Notch Setup
====================================

- Setup an :ref:`RPM sensor<common-rpm>`.
- Set :ref:`INS_HNTCH_MODE <INS_HNTCH_MODE>` and/or :ref:`INS_HNTC2_MODE <INS_HNTC2_MODE>` = 2 or 5 to use an RPM sensor to set the harmonic notch frequency.
- Set :ref:`INS_HNTCH_ENABLE <INS_HNTCH_ENABLE>` and/or :ref:`INS_HNTC2_ENABLE <INS_HNTC2_ENABLE>` = 1 to enable the harmonic notch
- Set :ref:`INS_HNTCH_REF <INS_HNTCH_REF>` and/or :ref:`INS_HNTC2_REF <INS_HNTC2_REF>` = 1 to set the harmonic notch reference value to unscaled, unless the RPM sensor is reporting a fraction of the actual rotor speed. This might occur in a geared drive train setup. If the reported RPM is 1/3 the actual, for example, set this to 0.33.
- Set :ref:`INS_HNTCH_FREQ <INS_HNTCH_FREQ>` and/or :ref:`INS_HNTC2_FREQ <INS_HNTC2_FREQ>` = below the hover frequency.  In the RPM based dynamic notch, this parameter sets the lower frequency limit of the notch.  So even if the RPM sensor reads a lower value, the notch's center frequency will remained constrainded to the value of this parameter.  You can easily determine the hover frequency by performing a hover and looking at the RPM sensor log data (e.g. RPM.rpm1).
- Set :ref:`INS_HNTCH_BW <INS_HNTCH_BW>` and/or :ref:`INS_HNTC2_BW <INS_HNTC2_BW>` = half of INS_HNTCH_FREQ

Checking Harmonic Notch Effectiveness
=====================================
Once the notch filter(s) are setup, the effectiveness of them can be checked by again measuring the  frequency spectrum of the output of the filters (which are the new inputs to the IMU sensors). Refer back to the :ref:`common-imu-batchsampling`  page for this.

While the log analysis of noise frequencies is not absolutely required prior to notch setup for RPM based mode, the logging and analysis done for the Confirmation flight using that method can be done in order to confirm the noise elimination, if desired.
