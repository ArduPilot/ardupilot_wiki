Lua Scripts
===========

ArduPilot has introduced experimental support for `Lua <https://www.lua.org/>`_ scripting.
Scripting provides a safe, "sandboxed" environment for new behaviours to be added to the autopilot without modifying the core flight code.
Scripts are stored on the SD card and run in parallel with the flight code.

This page describes how to setup scripts on your autopilot, the scripting API and some examples to help get started.

.. note::

    Lua scripting support was released with Copter-4.0, Rover-4.0 and Plane-3.11.

Getting Started
===============

- Ensure your autopilot has at least 2 MB’s of flash and 70KB of memory.  High powered autopilots like the Hex Cube Orange and HolyBro Durandal will certainly work well but check the specifications of your :ref:`autopilot <common-autopilots>`
- Set :ref:`SCR_ENABLE <SCR_ENABLE>` to 1 to enable scripting (refresh or reboot to see all ``SCR_`` parameters)
- Upload scripts (files with extension .lua) to the autopilot's SD card's ``APM/scripts`` folder (if this folder does not exist please create it).  If using Mission Planner this can be done using MAVFTP.  If using a simulator the ``scripts`` folder is in the directory the simulator was started from.

- Sample scripts can be found `here for stable Plane <https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot/tree/ArduPlane-stable/libraries/AP_Scripting/examples>`__, `Copter <https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot/tree/ArduCopter-stable/libraries/AP_Scripting/examples>`__ and `Rover <https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot/tree/APMrover2-stable/libraries/AP_Scripting/examples>`__.  The latest development scripts can be found `here <https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot/tree/master/libraries/AP_Scripting/examples>`__
- When the autopilot is powered on it will load and start all scripts
- Messages and errors are sent to the ground station and, if using Mission Planner, can be viewed in the Data screen's "Messages" tab
- :ref:`SCR_HEAP_SIZE <SCR_HEAP_SIZE>` can be adjusted to increase or decrease the amount of memory available for scripts.  The default of 43KB is sufficient for small scripts, and fits onto most autopilots.  The autopilot's free memory depends highly upon which features and peripherals are enabled.  If this parameter is set too low, scripts may fail to run.  If set too high other autopilot features including Terrain Following may fail to initialise.

What Scripts Can Do
===================

- Multiple scripts can be run at once
- Monitor the vehicle state
- Start to manipulate vehicle state

Lua is a garbage collected, imperative programming language.
Scripts are run at a low priority on the system, which ensures that the core flight code will continue to execute even if a script is taking a long time to process.
In order to allow multiple scripts to be run, each script is allocated a fixed time chunk (measured in VM instructions) in which it is expected to complete it’s processing.
The script is allowed to specify a new callback function and time at which it should be called, which allows it to be run continuously.
While this serves to bound the worst case execution time safely, scripts are not guaranteed to be run on a reliable schedule.

Each script is run in its own "sandboxed" environment.
This allows each script to manipulate any global variables it wants to without causing other scripts problems, and allows the script to persist state between calls to its callback.
A side effect of this however is that heavy memory usage in a script can cause other scripts to be short on memory.

A Sample Script
===============

The following script is used to change a servo output based on the aircraft's distance from the home position.

.. code-block:: lua
   :linenos:

   function update () -- periodic function that will be called
     local current_pos = ahrs:get_position() -- fetch the current position of the vehicle
     local home = ahrs:get_home()            -- fetch the home position of the vehicle
     if current_pos and home then            -- check that both a vehicle location, and home location are available
       local distance = current_pos:get_distance(home) -- calculate the distance from home in meters
       if distance > 1000 then -- if more then 1000 meters away
         distance = 1000;      -- clamp the distance to 1000 meters
       end
       servo.set_output_pwm(96, 1000 + distance) -- set the servo assigned function 96 (scripting3) to a proportional value
     end
   
     return update, 1000 -- request to be rerun again 1000 milliseconds (1 second) from now
   end

   return update, 1000   -- request to be rerun again 1000 milliseconds (1 second) from now 

This script begins by defining the update function, which will be called periodically.
This function fetches the vehicles current position and home position, and stores them within the local variables current_pos and home.
Both of these variables now either hold a Location userdata, or are nil, if the information was not currently available from the vehicle.
The variables are then checked to ensure that they were actually provided, before calculating the distance between the locations.
After a check to ensure that the distance is never measured as more then 1 kilometer away, the distance is used to set the servo position.
The final line in the function is used to reschedule this function to be run again in 1000 milliseconds from the current time.
The last line of the script is also used to schedule the function to be run for the first time in 1000 milliseconds from the time at which it's loaded.

Script Crashes and Errors
=========================
If scripts run out of memory (or panic for any reason) all currently running scripts are terminated, and the scripting engine will restart, and reload all scripts from the disk.
This is allowed to happen at all flight stages, even while the vehicle is armed and flying.

API Documentation
=================

The API documentation described here is not a complete list, but rather a work in progress. This list will be expanded upon in the near future. For a full list of the methods currently available, the `binding generator <https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot/blob/master/libraries/AP_Scripting/generator/description/bindings.desc>`_ source is the best reference currently available.

Location
~~~~~~~~

Location is a userdata object that holds locations expressed as latitude, longitude, altitude. The altitude can be in several different frames, relative to home, absolute altitude above mean sea level, or relative to terrain. To create a new Location userdata you can call Location() to allocate an empty location object, or call a method that returns one to you.

How to Add New Bindings
=======================

To give Lua scripts access to more features of ArduPilot the API can be extended by creating new bindings.  If the object is already available to Lua (i.e. AHRS, Location, etc) the process is as follows:

- Find the method or function you would like to expose to Lua.  For example if you wanted to expose an additional feature of AHRS you would first find the method within `libraries/AP_AHRS/AP_AHRS.h <https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot/blob/master/libraries/AP_AHRS/AP_AHRS.h>`__
- Edit the `libraries/AP_Scripting/generator/description/bindings.desc <https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot/blob/master/libraries/AP_Scripting/generator/description/bindings.desc>`__ and add a new line in the appropriate section for the method.
- Open a command line prompt and cd to the `/libraries/AP_Scripting/generator <https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot/tree/master/libraries/AP_Scripting/generator>`__ directory and type "make run"

`Here is an example PR <https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot/pull/11787>`__ which adds a binding for AHRS's get_roll, get_pitch and get_yaw methods.
