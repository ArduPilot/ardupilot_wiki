ArduPilot supports failsafes generated by several types of GeoFences (boundaries described by latitude/longitude and/or altitude) to prevent the vehicle from traveling higher or further than desired, or into unwanted areas. Types of GeoFences supported varies by vehicle.

For Copter, the Cylindrical Geo-Fence is a simple "tin-can" centered around HOME. In addition, there can also be inclusion and exclusion fences drawn, either circular or polygonal, or both, at various locations.

Inclusion and Exclusion Fences are defined easily in Mission Planner under the PLAN screen and loaded to the autopilot, using the  FENCES item in the drop down box, just like Missions or Rally Points are planned.
