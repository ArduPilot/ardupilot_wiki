Installing Ground Station (GCS) software
========================================

ArduPilot can be used with :ref:`many different ground stations <common-choosing-a-ground-station>`.

Developers typically use a *desktop* GCS, as these tend to provide deeper access to vehicle setup parameters and advanced debugging features. 
If you just want to fly you may instead choose to use a GCS running on a mobile OS (iOS, Android).

Installation links for some of the more popular GCS systems are provided below:
