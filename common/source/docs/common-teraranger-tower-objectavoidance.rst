The image above shows how to connect TeraRanger Tower to Serial4 on Pixhawk.
Recommended supply current is 345mA at 12V (accepted voltage range is 10-20V).

Configuration through the Ground Station
----------------------------------------

- :ref:`SERIAL4_PROTOCOL <SERIAL4_PROTOCOL>` = "11" ("Lidar360") if using Serial4.
- :ref:`SERIAL4_BAUD <SERIAL4_BAUD>` =  "921" if using Serial4.
- :ref:`PRX_TYPE <PRX_TYPE>` = "3" to enable the TeraRanger Tower (or 0 to disable).

More details on using this sensor for object avoidance on Copter can be found :ref:`here <copter-object-avoidance>`.
