Compass Calibration
===================

This article explains how to perform basic compass calibration. It assumes that you have at least one compass, either internally or externally in the system, and it has been enabled. See :ref:`Advanced Compass Setup <common-compass-setup-advanced>` for more information and to setup other compass related features.

.. tip::

   It is not necessary to recalibrate the compass when the vehicle is flown at a new location because ArduPilot includes a "world magnetic model" which allows converting the location's magnetic North to true North without recalibrating .  In addition the location's "inclination" is calibrated at startup and then again soon after takeoff. It is important that when compass calibration is done, the vehicle have a good 3D gps lock, in order to assure the best setup. If necessary, move outdoors in order to get a good 3D gps lock before doing the compass calibration.
   
.. note::

   Compass calibration cannot be performed while vehicle is armed.


Calibration first steps
=======================


.. warning:: Do not calibrate the compasses near any metallic or magnetic field producing object (computers, cell phones, metal desks, power supplies, etc.) or incorrect calibration will occur.


- Under **SETUP\| Mandatory Hardware** select **Compass**.

      Mission Planner: Compass Calibration

   You may wish to disable any internal compasses if you are consistently seeing the "inconsistent compasses" pre-arm message often and you are sure that the external compass is calibrated. 

.. _onboard_calibration:

Onboard Calibration
===================

"Onboard Calibration" is a calibration routine that runs on the autopilot.  This method is more accurate than the older "Offboard Calibration" (aka "Live Calibration") which runs on the ground station because in addition to offsets, scaling and orientation are also automatically determined.

.. note:: Calibration could fail for the onboard compasses if the :ref:`autopilot board orientation<AHRS_ORIENTATION>` parameter is not correct.

To perform the onboard calibration of all compasses:

- click the "Onboard Mag Calibration" section's "Start" button
- if your autopilot has a buzzer attached you should hear a single tone followed by short beep once per second
- hold the vehicle in the air and rotate it so that each side (front, back, left, right, top and bottom) points down towards the earth for a few seconds in turn. Consider a full 360-degree turn with each turn pointing a different direction of the vehicle to the ground. It will result in 6 full turns plus possibly some additional time and turns to confirm the calibration or retry if it initially does not pass.

      :target: ../_images/accel-calib-positions-e1376083327116.jpg

- as the vehicle is rotated the green bars should extend further and further to the right until the calibration completes
- upon successful completion three rising tones will be emitted and a "Please reboot the autopilot" window will appear and you will need to reboot the autopilot before it is possible to arm the vehicle.


If calibration fails:

- you will hear an "unhappy" failure tone, the green bars may reset to the left, and the calibration routine may restart (depending upon the ground station). Mission Planner will automatically retry, so continue to rotate the vehicle as instructed above.
- if a compass is not calibrating, consider moving to a different area away from magnetic disturbances, and remove electronics from your pockets.
- if, after multiple attempts, the compass has not passed the calibration, Press the "Cancel" button and change the "Fitness" drop-down to a more relaxed setting and try again.
- if compass calibration still fails it may help to raise :ref:`COMPASS_OFFS_MAX <COMPASS_OFFS_MAX>` from 850 to 2000 or even 3000
- finally, if a single compass is not calibrating and you trust the others, disable it.

Onboard Calibration using Stick Gestures (no GCS)
=================================================

.. note:: This feature has  been removed in firmware versions after 4.1.

ArduPilot supports "Onboard Calibration using RC Controller stick gestures" meaning that the calibration routine runs on the autopilot with no GCS.  This method is more accurate than the older "Offboard Calibration" (aka "Live Calibration") which runs on the ground station because in addition to offsets, scaling is also calculated.

- requires RC calibration first
- to start compass calibration hold throttle stick full up and full right yaw for 2 seconds
- if your autopilot has a buzzer attached you should hear a single tone followed by short beep once per second
- hold the vehicle in the air and rotate it so that each side (front, back, left, right, top and bottom) points down towards the earth for a few seconds in turn

   .. figure:: ../../../images/accel-calib-positions-e1376083327116.jpg
      :target: ../_images/accel-calib-positions-e1376083327116.jpg

- upon successful completion three rising tones will be emitted and you will need to reboot the autopilot before it is possible to arm the vehicle.

If calibration fails:

- you will hear a failure tone and the calibration routine will restart
- to cancel calibration at anytime hold throttle stick full up and full left yaw for 2 seconds
- if, after multiple attempts, you are unable to calibrate the compass, Cancel with stick and use normal Onboard Calibration from GCS above

Large Vehicle MagCal
====================

Large or heavy vehicles are impractical to rotate on all axis. This feature allows a fairly accurate calibration if GPS lock is active on the autopilot and the vehicles actual heading is known, either using a landmark reference on the Mission Planner map, or using another compass (eg cell phone) and entering the vehicles heading.

Compass Ordering
================

At the top of the page, you can change the priority of the attached compasses, if desired.
