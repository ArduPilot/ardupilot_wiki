RadioLink MiniPix
========================================


.. warning:: This autopilot is not recommended because some versions of the board are not compatible with the official ArduPilot software despite multiple efforts to work with the manufacturer to make them compatible. The manufacturer is also apparently not abiding by the GPLv3 license which requires releasing the modified source code to its customers.  "V1.0" and "V1.2" probably work, "V1.0 II" and "V1.1" definitely do not work.

Default UART order
==================

- SERIAL0 = console = USB
- SERIAL1 = Telemetry1 = USART3
- SERIAL2 = Telemetry2 = USART2 (see Notes for reversed plastic case labels!)
- SERIAL3 = GPS1 = UART4


Serial protocols can be adjusted to personal preferences.


Firmware handling
=================

This hardware comes preflashed with a RadioLink-branded version of ArduCopter and an ArduPilot-compatible bootloader. To use non-branded ChibiOS-based ArduPilot firmware versions, download the required vehicle firmware .apj file from https://firmware.ardupilot.org/ and flash your board using MissionPlanner's "custom firmware" option.

In case a bootloader re-installation is required, you can boot your board to DFU-mode using the following solder-points:

    :target: ../_images/minipix_dfu.jpg

Then follow the instructions on how to :ref:`load firmware onto ChibiOS boards <common-loading-firmware-onto-chibios-only-boards>`.


.. warning::
    The flightcontroller's plastic case shows the telemetry ports' numbers reversed compared to the board's PCB imprints and the  
    firmware's SERIALn assignments, this requires additional attention!
    
.. note::
    MiniPix voltage and current sensing pins use Pixhawk standard ( :ref:`BATT_VOLT_PIN<BATT_VOLT_PIN>` = 2, :ref:`BATT_CURR_PIN<BATT_CURR_PIN>` = 3).
    The additional ADC pin can be used for either RSSI or analog airspeed. Set required option to PIN = 11.
