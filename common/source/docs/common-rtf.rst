===================================
Ready-To-Fly & Easy-To-Buy vehicles
===================================

The following is a list of ready-to-fly vehicles that run ArduPilot that can be easily purchased over the internet.
These vehicles come pre-configured with everything required to fly, drive or swim right out of the box.

.. note::

   We recommend, when possible, to purchase from our `Partners <http://ardupilot.org/about/Partners>`__ because they directly support ArduPilot and we are more confident that users can upgrade the firmware on the vehicle.
