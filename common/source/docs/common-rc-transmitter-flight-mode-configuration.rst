RC Transmitter Flight Mode Configuration
========================================

This article shows how you can enable up to 6 autopilot control/flight
modes to be set from your RC transmitter.

Flight modes configuration
==========================

The mapping between switch position and flight mode is set in the
*Mission Planner Flight Mode* screen.

You can set up the flight modes available on the transmitter by doing
the following:


-  Turn on your RC transmitter
-  Connect the Pixhawk (or other autopilot) to the *Mission Planner*
-  Go to the **Initial Setup \| Mandatory Hardware \| Flight Modes** screen

   .. note::

      As you move your transmitter's flight mode switch the green
      highlight bar will move to a different position.

-  Use the drop-down on each line to select the flight mode for that
   switch position.

[site wiki="copter"]
-  (Copter) Ensure that at least one switch position is left assigned to
   STABILISE.
[/site]

[site wiki="copter"]
-  (Copter) Optionally check the :ref:`Simple Mode <copter:simpleandsuper-simple-modes_simple_mode>`
   check-box for that switch position. You can
   optionally set :ref:`Super Simple mode <copter:simpleandsuper-simple-modes_super_simple_mode>`.
   If both Simple mode and Super Simple mode checkboxes are checked
   Super Simple will be used.
[/site]

-  When finished press the **Save Modes** button.

[site wiki="copter"]
(Copter) Some modes can also be invoked from the :ref:`auxiliary switches <copter:channel-7-and-8-options>`
(a.k.a. ch7, ch8 option switches). For example, to set a dedicated
switch for RTL.
[/site]

Setting the flight mode channel
===============================

The flight mode channel is the input radio channel that ArduPilot
monitors for mode changes.

[site wiki="copter"]
On Copter this is always channel 5.
[/site]
[site wiki="plane"]
On Plane this is configurable using the :ref:`FLTMODE_CH <plane:FLTMODE_CH>`
parameter. 
[/site]
[site wiki="rover"]
On Rover this is configurable using the :ref:`MODE_CH <rover:MODE_CH>` parameter
[/site]

Transmitter configuration
=========================

The transmitter must emit PWM signals in the correct range to allow us
to map a mode to a switch position.

.. note::
 |   Generally the range is between 1000 to 2000 us (1.0 to 2.0 ms).
 |   ms = millisecond
 |   us = microsecond

   The correct PWM ranges for selectable modes are shown alongside
   each mode selection dropdown in the *Mission Planner Flight Mode* screen
   (see :ref:`screenshot above <common-rc-transmitter-flight-mode-configuration_flight_modes_configuration>`). 

If you want to just support three modes (using a three position switch)
then you would configure the transmitter to produce PWM pulse widths of
1165, 1425, and 1815 us for the respective switch positions.

If you want to support 6 modes then the transmitter will need to emit
PWM widths of around 1165, 1295, 1425, 1555, 1685, and 1815
us. Typically this is achieved by configuring the transmitter
to mix a two position switch and a three position switch (giving 6 modes
in total). You can also do this with an analog dial if one is available,
but it’s hard to reliably turn a dial to just the right position for six
distinct settings.

The sections below provide links showing how to configure transmitters
from different manufactures, and how to test (in Mission Planner) that
each switch setting is emitting the appropriate PWM signal.

Test transmitter switch settings
--------------------------------

You can use the *Mission Planner Radio Calibration* screen to test the
PWM pulse widths for each mode setting.

Simply toggle through the modes on your transmitter and confirm that the
PWM for the selected channel matches the required PWM values. The
screenshot below assumes that the flight mode channel is set to Radio 5.

Tutorials for specific RC hardware
----------------------------------

Here are some user-contributed tutorials for doing this (or adding more
modes to RC units with just a two-position toggle) with various RC
systems:

-  **Any OpenTX based transmitter:**

Simply select two switches (one must be three position) and add these mixes on the appropriate flight mode channel used for your vehicle. The example below shows it for a plane using Channel 8 for flight mode (default) and using switch SB selecting three flight modes with SA switch up , and selecting an additional three flight modes via SB when SA is not in the up position.

Spektrum DX8 (alternate method)
-------------------------------

This section describes an alternative way to set 6 modes with the
Spektrum DX8. This method uses the Gear switch and the Flight mode
switch. All the other switches can be assigned as preferred. This method
also allows each mode to be set in the middle of each mode's pulse width
range so small changes will not change modes. Use Mission Planner Flight
Modes setup to monitor the Current PWM for these adjustments.

#. Setup the switches (required for the 6 modes)

   -  Hold roller bar down, turn on DX8, scroll down to Switch Select,
      Click roller bar.  Set switches as follows:
      
      -  Gear = Gear (Channel 5)
      -  FMode = Inh  Not assigned to a channel – Used to mix with Gear Sw (Channel 5) for 6 modes
      
   -  Others anyway you want. One method is as follows:

      -  Knob to aux1 = channel 6 for camera tilt / tuning
      -  Mix = aux2 = channel 7 to save Way Point or RTL, auto trim or
         other settings in APM configuration.
      -  Flap to aux3 = channel 8 for other uses

   -  Click BACK until the normal screen appears, or turn off power,
      then turn power back on.

#. Set up the non-mixed servo setting for channel 5 (Gear channel
   controlled by the Gear Switch)

   This will be the values with no mixing - F Mode switch in the 0
   position and sets the lowest pulse width to 1165 us (mode 1) and
   highest to 1815 us (mode 6)

-  Click the roller bar, scroll down to Servo Setup, Select the Gear
   channel, Select Sub Trim.
-  Set sub trim to 0
-  Select Travel.
-  Set travel (left, position 0) for 1165 us pulse  (~90%).
-  Set travel (right, position 1 for 1815 us pulse (~74%).
-  Set up Mix 1 to change the Gear Pulse width when F Mode is in
   position 1

   -  Click roller, scroll down to Mixing, click roller, scroll to first
      line under Mix (has xxx > xxx, AIL > RUD, or some other mix
      set),click roller, Select Mix 1, Click roller.
   -  Set Mix: Gear > Gear. Gear changes Gear depending on Switch F Mode
      setting
   -  Set Offset = 0, Trim = Inh.
   -  Set SW = FM 1
   -  Set the F Mode switch on the transmitter to position 1.
   -  Set the Gear switch on the transmitter to position 0.
   -  Set top Rate for pulse width of 1290 us for mode 2  (~-35%)

      (change = 400 us \* -90% \* -35% = 126 us. Result = 1165 us + 126
      us = 1251 us = mode 2)
   -  Set the Gear switch on the transmitter to position 1.
   -  Set bottom Rate for pulse width of 1685 us for mode 5  (~– 45%)

      (change = 400 us \* +73% \*- 45% = -131 us. Result = 1815 us - 131
      us = 1684 us = mode 5)

-  Set up a mix 2 to change the Gear Pulse width when F Mode is in
   position 2

   -  Mix: Gear > Gear.  Gear changes Gear depending on Switch F Mode
      setting.
   -  Set Offset = 0, Trim = Inh
   -  Set SW = FM2
   -  Set the F Mode switch on the transmitter to position 2
   -  Set the Gear switch on the transmitter to position 0.
   -  Rate top Rate for pulse width of 1425 us for mode 3  (~–72%)
      (change = 400 us \* –90% \* – 72% = 259 us.  Result = 1165 us +
      259 us = 1424 us = mode 3)
   -  Set the Gear switch on the transmitter to position 1.
   -  Set bottom Rate for pulse width of 1550 us for mode 4  (~–89%)
      (change = 400 us \* +73% \* – 89% = -262 us.  Result = 1815 us -
      262 us = 1553 us = mode 4)
