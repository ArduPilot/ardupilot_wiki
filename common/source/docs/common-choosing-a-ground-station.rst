Choosing a Ground Station
=========================

This page gives a high-level overview of the available Ground Control
Stations (GCS) and provides links so you can make the appropriate
choice.

Overview
========

A ground station is typically a software application, running on a
ground-based computer, that communicates with your UAV via :ref:`wireless telemetry <common-telemetry-landingpage>`. It displays real-time data
on the UAVs performance and position and can serve as a “virtual
cockpit”, showing many of the same instruments that you would have if
you were flying a real plane. A GCS can also be used to control a UAV in
flight, uploading new mission commands and setting parameters. It is
often also used to monitor the live video streams from a UAV’s cameras.

There are at least ten different ground control stations. On desktop there is (*Mission
Planner*, *APM Planner 2*, *MAVProxy*, *QGroundControl* and *UgCS*. For Tablet/Smartphone there is
*Tower* (DroidPlanner 3), *MAVPilot*, *AndroPilot* and *SidePilot* that can be
used to communicate with ArduPilot (i.e.
:ref:`Copter <copter:home>`,
`Plane <https://ardupilot.org/plane/index.html>`_,
:ref:`Rover <rover:home>`,
:ref:`AntennaTracker <antennatracker:home>`).

The decision to select a particular GCS often depends on your vehicle
and preferred computing platform:

-  **Ready-to-fly** users may prefer the portability and ease of use of
   *Tower* (Droid Planner 3), or another GCS running on a tablet or
   phone.
-  **DIY/Kit** users and developers often have to access configuration
   and analysis tools, and would therefore need (at least initially)
   *Mission Planner*, *APM Planner 2* or another more full-featured GCS.

.. note::

   This wiki primarily refers to set-up and configuration using the
   Mission Planner, because it was created first and is the most
   full-featured GCS.

Supports APM, Pixhawk as well as drones from other manufacturers such as DJI, Mikrokopter and more.
Intended for enthusiasts as well as professional users.

It is capable of communicating with and controlling multiple drones simultaneously. 

UgCS supports multiple map layers as well as different map providers. Some of the features of UgCS include - DEM Import, ADS-B transponder and receiver support, Click & Go mode, Joystick mode, image geotagging and video recording. UgCS also comes with a telemetry player, allowing the replay of all flights. 

UgCS comes with in-built no-fly zones around all major airports as well as the ability to create custom no-fly zones.

Supports multi-node installation, meaning that it is possible to connect multiple pilots with UgCS laptops in the field to a central ground control server.
