Safety
======

Operating a powered vehicle of any kind can be a lot of fun. 
However, nothing will ruin your day at the park more quickly than an accident or running afoul of the law. 
Since we want you to have a great experience, please make sure that you do all of the following:

* Operate within all local laws and regulations. 
  For example, in the United States, current regulations require you to operate most UAVs under 400 
  foot above ground level, within line of site, and away from obstructions and populated areas. 
  Since these regulations vary from place to place, even within the same country, ensure that 
  you understand what you need to do to stay compliant.
* Never operate the vehicle or software in a way that could be dangerous to you, other people, or property. 
  Propellers, while rotating, could easily cut you; if a UAV fell on a person or object, 
  it could cause injury; a UAV caught in power lines could cause an outage. 
  As Ben Franklin said, “An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.”
* Always keep in mind that software and hardware failures happen. 
  Although we design our products to minimize such issues, you should always operate with the understanding that 
  a failure could occur at any point of time and without warning. 
  As such, you should take the appropriate precautions to minimize danger in case of failure.
* Never use the software or hardware for manned vehicles. 
  The software and hardware we provide is only for use in unmanned vehicles.
