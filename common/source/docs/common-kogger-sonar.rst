KOGGER Underwater Sonar
=======================


The `KOGGER Sonar <https://kogger.tech/product/sonar-2d-enhanced>`__ is a compact and low-cost underwater echosounder module with UART interface, 5-14Volts Power Supply Voltage.

Recommended Hardware
--------------------
- CP210x USB->UART converter and Windows PC with `Kogger Application <https://github.com/koggertech/KoggerApp/releases/latest>`__ installed.

Configuring the echosounder module
----------------------------------
The module should be configured before it is connected to the ArduPilot. You need the KOGGER Sonar module connected to computer.
The GUI is opensource `Kogger Application <https://github.com/koggertech/KoggerApp/>`__.


- Make the following adjustment in the GUI:

.. image:: ../../../images/kogger-application.png
    :target: ../_images/kogger-aplication.png

- Select the assigned COM-port and press green RUN button
- Set the following rangefinder parameters:
    - Max distance = 50000
    - Dead zone = 100
    - Confidence = 0
- Set the following transducer parameters:
     - Pulse count = 10
     - Frequency = 700kHz
     - Booster = ON
- Set the following dataset parameters:
     - Period = 100ms
     - Rangefinder = NMEA
- Press "Flash settings"

Thatâ€™s it. The module is ready to use with autopilot.

Connecting to the ArduPilot hardware
------------------------------------
The KOGGER Sonar provides distance measurements using the NMEA protocol over serial/uart.

If the SERIAL2 (TELEM2) is used then the following parameters should be set:

    :target: ../_imagesimages/kogger-sonar-pixhawk.png
    
The sensor can be connected to any available serial/uart port on the autopilot. In the diagram below the first sensor is connected to SERIAL2 (TELEM2).



-  :ref:`SERIAL2_PROTOCOL <SERIAL2_PROTOCOL>` = 9 (Lidar)
-  :ref:`SERIAL2_BAUD <SERIAL2_BAUD>` = 115 (115200 baud)

Then the following range finder related parameters should be set:

-  :ref:`RNGFND1_TYPE <RNGFND1_TYPE>` = 17 (NMEA)
-  :ref:`RNGFND1_MIN_CM <RNGFND1_MIN_CM>` = 30
-  :ref:`RNGFND1_MAX_CM <RNGFND1_MAX_CM>` = 5000 (i.e. 50m).  *This is the distance in centimeters that the rangefinder can reliably read.*
-  :ref:`RNGFND1_ORIENT <RNGFND1_ORIENT>` = 25 (i.e. down) if mounted on a boat


Testing the sensor
==================

Distances read by the sensor can be seen in the Mission Planner's Flight
Data screen's Status tab. Look closely for "sonarrange".
