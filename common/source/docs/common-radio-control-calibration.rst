Radio Control Calibration in Mission Planner
============================================

This article shows how to perform radio control calibration using
*Mission Planner*.

Overview
========

RC transmitters are used to control vehicle movement and orientation.
Copter and Plane minimally control throttle, pitch, roll and yaw, while
on Rover we just control throttle and roll. Each of these control
signals are mapped to transmitter stick/switch(s) and in turn to
autopilot channels from the connected receiver.

Calibrating each of the transmitter controls/channels is a
straightforward process - simply move each of the enabled
sticks/switches through their full range and record the maximum and
minimum positions.

Transmitter configuration
-------------------------

There are two main transmitter configurations:

-  *Mode 1*: left stick controls pitch and yaw, the right stick will
   control throttle and roll.
-  *Mode 2*: left stick controls throttle and yaw; the right stick will
   control pitch and roll.

roll from the same stick.[/site]

Channel mappings
----------------

[site wiki="copter"]

Copter default channel mappings are:

-  **Channel 1**: Roll
-  **Channel 2**: Pitch
-  **Channel 3**: Throttle
-  **Channel 4**: Yaw
-  **Channel 5**: Flight modes
-  **Channel 6**: (Optional) Inflight tuning or camera mount (mapped to
   transmitter tuning knob)

[/site]

[site wiki="plane"]

Plane default channel mappings are:

-  **Channel 1**: Roll
-  **Channel 2**: Pitch
-  **Channel 3**: Throttle
-  **Channel 4**: Yaw
-  **Channel 8** (default): Flight modes. Mode selection can be mapped
   to any RC channel using the ``FLTMODE_CH`` parameter.

[/site]

[site wiki="rover"]

Rover default channel mappings are:

-  **Channel 1**: Steer
-  **Channel 3**: Throttle
-  **Channel 8** (default): Flight modes. Mode selection can be mapped
   to any RC channel using the ``MODE_CH`` parameter.

[/site]

Unused channels can be mapped to control additional peripherals.

.. note::

   -  The default channel mappings can be changed using the instructions in
      :ref:`RCMAP Input Channel Mapping <common-rcmap>`.
   -  Once you've calibrated the flight mode you can use the instructions
      in :ref:`RC Transmitter Flight Mode Configuration <common-rc-transmitter-flight-mode-configuration>` to
      specify which vehicle modes are enabled by each switch position.

Preconditions
=============

Safety first
------------

For safety reasons you should disconnect the battery and/or remove
propellers before preforming radio calibration.

Centre trims
------------

Centre trims in manual RC mode before preforming RC calibration. If
trims are not centred you may need to do the RC calibration again after
you have used the vehicle (this is easy to do at the field).

.. note::

   Trims are centred when a moving vehicle does not change
   direction/speed/orientation when travelling hands-off with all
   controls/sticks in neutral positions. If there is any deviation in
   direction, speed or orientation, adjust the associated servo to
   compensate. 

Connect autopilot and turn on receiver
--------------------------------------

Connect the autopilot via USB and turn on your RC transmitter. Verify
that the transmitter is bound to the receiver (the receiver displays a
solid green light) and that it is set to use the correct model for your
vehicle.

Open Mission Planner's **INITIAL SETUP \| Mandatory Hardware \| Radio
Calibration** screen. If your RC receiver (Rx) and transmitter (Tx) are
bound, you should see the green bars move when you move the transmitter
sticks.

.. tip::

   If the bars are not moving then check what LED lights the receiver
   is displaying:

   -  no lights - may indicate that it is incorrectly wired to the
      autopilot (look for connectors that may have been inserted upside
      down).
   -  red or a flashing green light - may indicate that your RC
      transmitter/receiver need be bound (see the manual that came with
      your RC equipment for instructions).
   -  a solid green light - recheck the autopilot is connected to the
      *Mission Planner* and if the bars are still not moving, try clicking
      on the **Calibrate Radio** button.

Calibration steps
=================

#. Open Mission Planner's **INITIAL SETUP \| Mandatory Hardware \| Radio
   Calibration** screen.
#. Click on the green **Calibrate Radio** button in the lower right of
   the window.

   Mission Planner will display a prompt to check radio control
   equipment is on, battery is not connected, and propellers are not
   attached. Select **OK**.

   .. figure:: ../../../images/mp_calibrate_radio.jpg
      :target: ../_images/mp_calibrate_radio.jpg

      Mission Planner: Select Calibrate Radio and OK to begin calibrating.

#. Move the control sticks and toggle switches on your transmitter to
   their limits of travel and observe the results on the radio
   calibration bars. Red lines will appear across the calibration bars
   to indicate maximum and minimum values:

      :target: ../_images/mp_radio_calibration_click_when_done.jpg

      Mission Planner: Input range marked with red lines

   .. tip::

      The green bars should move in the **same direction** as the
         transmitter sticks (except for Pitch where the bars move opposite to
         stick movements - low values are forward, high values are back).  If
         the green bars move in the wrong direction, reverse them using your
         RC transmitter's channel-reverse function (see your RC gear's manual
         for guidance).

   You should also calibrate the channel you have selected for
   controlling vehicle mode, and any other channels you have connected
   to the autopilot.

   [site wiki="rover"]Servos should move in the same direction when
   under autopilot control as they do in MANUAL mode. If not, select the
   **Reverse** checkbox for the associated channel. [/site]

   [site wiki="plane"]This screen is also where you set up elevon mode
   and servo reversal. For more information see :ref:`Normal/Elevon/VTail Mode & Reversing Servos <plane:reversing-servos-and-setting-normalelevon-mode>`.[/site]

#. Select **Click when Done** when all required channels are set at the
   minimum and maximum positions.

   Mission Planner will show a summary of the calibration data. Normal
   values are around 1100 for minimums and 1900 for maximums.

#. Turn off your transmitter and disconnect the battery if it was
   connected.
