===================
When Problems Arise
===================

ArduPilot, is extremely capable and flexible. But with high performance and flexibility comes a lot of configurations, parameters, and complexity.

This WIKI documentation attempts to reduce the effort of configuring and operating your ArduPilot based vehicle by providing as much accurate information on configuration, parameters, and operating modes as possible, and is continuously being updated as new releases occur or areas needing further explanation arise. Your assistance in that effort is welcomed and solicited. See :ref:`common_wiki_editing_guide`

What to do if you have an issue
===============================

1. Make sure you have followed the vehicle's "First Time Setup" and "First Flight/Drive" Sections and carefully read the provided documentation. If dealing with advanced configuration or hardware options, thoroughly read the appropriate documentation.

2. If this does not help you resolve the issue, then seek help on the `Discuss Forum <https://discuss.ardupilot.org/>`__ section appropriate to your vehicle or ground station. Do not enter issues on the GitHub software repositories or Gitter Developer Channels unless it has been confirmed as an actual issue in the code or documentation. Support will be given in the appropriate Discuss Forum.

3. Having a :Ref:`dataflash log <common-diagnosing-problems-using-logs>` will help you, or someone helping you, to diagnose the issue.
