ADTi Cameras and Gimbals
========================

The `ADTi <https://www.adti.camera/>`__ manufactures and sells a `range of high resolution cameras <https://www.adti.camera/adti-products>`__ which are most often paired with :ref:`Gremsy gimbals <common-gremsy-pixyu-gimbal>`

Where to Buy
------------

These gimbals can be purchased directly from `ADTi <https://www.adti.camera/contact>`__

Connecting to the Autopilot
---------------------------

Connect the camera's SHUTTER pin to one of the autopilot's PWM outputs (e.g. AUXOUT 5).  Below is the wiring for a ADTi 24sv3 but the port location may be different for each camera type.
Please open the `ADTi support site <https://www.adti.camera/support>`__, select your camera type and refer to the "Camera Engineer Drawings" to find the SHUTTER pin location for your camera

To control the camera shutter using PWM set the following parameters.  These parameters assume the autopilot's AUXOUT 5 is connected to the camera's shutter trigger

- :ref:`CAM1_TYPE <CAM1_TYPE>` = 1 (Servo)
- :ref:`CAM1_DURATION <CAM1_DURATION>` = 0.4 seconds
- :ref:`CAM1_SERVO_OFF <CAM1_SERVO_OFF>` = 1250
- :ref:`CAM1_SERVO_ON <CAM1_SERVO_ON>` = 1850
- :ref:`SERVO13_FUNCTION <SERVO13_FUNCTION>` = 10 (CameraTrigger)

To control the camera shutter using a :ref:`Relay <common-relay>` set the following parameters.  These parameters assume the autopilot's AUXOUT 5 is connected to the camera's shutter trigger

- :ref:`CAM1_TYPE <CAM1_TYPE>` = 2 (Relay)
- :ref:`CAM1_DURATION <CAM1_DURATION>` = 0.4 seconds
- :ref:`CAM1_RELAY_ON <CAM1_RELAY_ON>` = 0 (Low)
- :ref:`RELAY1_PIN <RELAY1_PIN>` = 54 (AUXOUT5)
- :ref:`SERVO13_FUNCTION <SERVO13_FUNCTION>` = -1 (GPIO)

Optionally the camera shutter can be triggered from a transmitter auxiliary switch.  The parameter below assumes the pilot wishes to use RC channel 9

- :ref:`RC9_OPTION <RC9_OPTION>` = 9 ("Camera Trigger") to take a picture

Configuring the Gimbal
----------------------

Please refer to the :ref:`Gremsy gimbal setup instructions <common-gremsy-pixyu-gimbal>` for details on how to configure the gimbal

Control and Testing
-------------------

See :ref:`Gimbal / Mount Controls <common-mount-targeting>` and :ref:`Camera Controls <common-camera-controls>`  for details on how to control the camera and gimbal using RC, GCS or Auto mode mission commands
