Cylindrical Fence
=================

Overview
========

ArduPilot includes a simple "tin can" shaped fence centered
on home that will attempt to stop your copter/rover from flying/driving too far away
by stopping at the fence in some Copter/Rover modes if :ref:`common-object-avoidance-landing-page` is setup and executing a configurable action.
The maximum circular distance and altitude (altitude used by Plane and Copter only) and the vehicle behavior when the fence is reached can be configured using a ground station like Mission Planner or QGC.

Rover Actions
-------------

Rover has no altitude actions, but if it reaches the Cylindrical fence boundary in either Steering or Acro modes, it will simply stop and not move beyond it. In other modes, it will execute the :ref:`FENCE_ACTION<FENCE_ACTION>`.

Copter Actions
--------------

Copter will stop increasing altitude at :ref:`FENCE_ALT_MAX<FENCE_ALT_MAX>` in Loiter, PosHold, and AltHold modes.

In Loiter mode, it will stop at the horizontal boundaries.

In other modes, it will execute the :ref:`FENCE_ACTION<FENCE_ACTION>` below if the altitude or boundary is reached.

+------------+--------------------+-------------------+
+FENCE_ACTION|  Copter            | Rover             +
+============+====================+===================+
+     0      |   Report Only                          +
+------------+--------------------+-------------------+
+     1      | RTL/LAND           | RTL/HOLD          +
+------------+--------------------+-------------------+
+     2      |LAND                | HOLD              +

+------------+--------------------+-------------------+
+     4      | BRAKE/LAND         |SmartRTL/HOLD      +
+------------+--------------------+-------------------+
+     5      | SmartRTL or  LAND  | not applicable    +
+------------+--------------------+-------------------+

.. note:: RTL/HOLD,etc. means it will attempt RTL first, but if it can't switch to that mode (ie for RTL, GPS lock is lost), it will attempt to switch to the next,in this case HOLD.

At the moment the fence is breached a backup fence is erected 20m
further out (or up).  If the vehicle breaches this backup fence (for
example if the the vehicle is not set up correctly or the operator takes
control but is unable to bring the copter back towards home), the vehicle
will execute the :ref:`FENCE_ACTION<FENCE_ACTION>` again (and another backup fence an additional
20m further out will be created if this is breached again).

If the vehicle eventually proceeds 100m outside the configured fence
distance, despite the backup fences, the vehicle will switch into LAND mode (HOLD for Rover).  The idea being that it's clearly impossible to get the vehicle home so best to just bring it
down/stop it.  The pilot can still retake control of course with the flight mode
switches.  Like with the earlier fences, another fence is erected 20m
out which will again switch the vehicle to LAND (HOLD for Rover), if it continues away from
home.

Plane Actions
-------------

If, enabled, and  the fence radius (:ref:`FENCE_RADIUS<FENCE_RADIUS>`) or altitudes, if non-zero, (:ref:`FENCE_ALT_MAX<FENCE_ALT_MAX>` and :ref:`FENCE_ALT_MIN<FENCE_ALT_MIN>`) are exceeded, Plane will execute the :ref:`FENCE_ACTION<FENCE_ACTION>` below:

+------------+--------------------+
+FENCE_ACTION|  Plane             +
+============+====================+
+     0      |   Report Only      +
+------------+--------------------+
+     1      | RTL                +
+------------+--------------------+
+     6      | Guided to return   +
+            | point              +
+------------+--------------------+
+     7      |  Guided to return  +
+            |  point with pilot  +
+            |  throttle control  +
+------------+--------------------+

If :ref:`FENCE_ACTION<FENCE_ACTION>` is set to a guided return mode (6 or 7), the altitude at which it returns is determined by :ref:`FENCE_RET_ALT<FENCE_RET_ALT>`. If a fence return point is not setup(see video below) for these actions, the vehicle will RTL.

The return point can also be replaced by the nearest rally point (See: :ref:`common-rally-points`) as a destination, if :ref:`FENCE_RET_RALLY<FENCE_RET_RALLY>` is enabled.


Enabling the Fence in Mission Planner
=====================================

To enable Fences, go to the Mission Planner full parameter list (CONFIG->Full Parameter Tree), search for items with ``FENCE_``:

.. image:: ../../../images/fence_enable.png
    :target: ../_images/fence_enable.png

Plane Parameter List (Copter/Rover have fewer)

-  Set :ref:`FENCE_ACTION<FENCE_ACTION>` = to whatever you wish for a breach action. These will vary depending on vehicle type.
-  Set :ref:`FENCE_ALT_MAX<FENCE_ALT_MAX>` = to the altitude limit relative to home you want (in meters). This is unavailable in Rover.
-  Set :ref:`FENCE_ENABLE<FENCE_ENABLE>` =1 to enable FENCEs.
-  Set :ref:`FENCE_MARGIN<FENCE_MARGIN>` = to the distance from the fence horizontal boundary the vehicle must maintain in order to prevent a breach.
-  Set :ref:`FENCE_RADIUS<FENCE_RADIUS>` to the maximum distance from HOME you want (in meters). This should normally be at least 50m. This value must be larger than :ref:`FENCE_MARGIN<FENCE_MARGIN>` and greater than 30m.
-  :ref:`FENCE_TOTAL<FENCE_TOTAL>` should not be changed manually and indicates the number of inclusion/exclusion fence points stored. (See :ref:`common-polygon_fence`)
-  Set :ref:`FENCE_TYPE<FENCE_TYPE>` = is a bitmap set to enable the various fence types: MIN or MAX altitude, simple CIRCLE tin can around HOME, or POLYGON fences. The POLYGON fences must also have been loaded via a fence list from a ground control station in order to be active.

.. note:: Polygon fence type includes the circular fences specified in the Inclusion/Exclusion fence list. The simple home centered CIRCLE fence is a separate fence. Rover ignores altitudes, if set.

Defaults for :ref:`FENCE_TYPE<FENCE_TYPE>` are:

- Rover: CIRCLE and POLYGON
- Copter: ALT MAX, CIRCLE, and POLYGON
- Plane: POLYGON

If Plane, you can also:

-  Set the :ref:`FENCE_ALT_MIN<FENCE_ALT_MIN>` as a breach boundary.
-  Set :ref:`FENCE_AUTOENABLE<FENCE_AUTOENABLE>` = to allow automatic temporary (until reboot) forcing of :ref:`FENCE_ENABLE<FENCE_ENABLE>` =1 under certain vehicle conditions, such as arming or takeoff. A value of 0 disables this feature.
-  :ref:`FENCE_RET_RALLY<FENCE_RET_RALLY>` allows returning to the nearest RALLY point (See: :ref:`common-rally-points`), if loaded, instead of HOME.

Copter GeoFence Tab
-------------------

Copter and Traditional Heli , when connected to Mission Planner, present a CONFIG tab called GeoFence which provides another way to access these parameters in those vehicles.

Enabling the fence with an RC Channel Auxiliary Switch
======================================================

It is not necessary to set-up a switch to enable or disable the fence
but if you wish to control the fence with a switch follow these
steps:

for firmware versions before 4.0:

-  Go to the Mission Planner's Config/Tuning > Extended Tuning screen and set
   either "Ch7 Opt" OR "Ch8 Opt" to Fence. These parameters can also be directly set from the Config/Tuning > Full Parameter List screen
   
.. image:: ../../../images/Fence_MPCh78.png
    :target: ../_images/Fence_MPCh78.png
   
Alternatively, for firmware versions 4.0 or later, an RCx_OPTION can be set via the Config/Tuning > Full Parameter List screen:

-  Use an RCx_OPTION set to Fence
-  setting the switch high (i.e. PWM > 1800) will enable the fence, low
   (under 1800) will disable the fence.


Warnings:
=========

-  The minimum recommended fence radius is 30m
-  The fence requires the GPS to be functioning well so do not disable the :ref:`GPS arming check <common-prearm-safety-checks>` nor the :ref:`EKF failsafe <ekf-inav-failsafe>` while the fence is enabled. Conversely, if you disable either of these checks, disable the Fence.
-  For the best results, ensure RTL is working on your vehicle.
-  With the Fence enabled in Copter and Rover, the pre-arm checks will require you have GPS
   lock before arming the vehicle.
-  In Copter, if EKF failsafe occurs and the Fence is enabled and you lose
   GPS lock while flying the fence will be disabled.
-  In Copter, if EKF failsafe occurs and the Fence is enabled and in an autonomous mode, the vehicle will switch to LAND (HOLD for Rover) because we no
   longer know the vehicle position and we want to ensure the vehicle
   never travels far outside the fence. If this is not desired,
   the pilot can retake control by moving the flight mode switch to a manual mode.
-  The Copter and Rover backup fences are created 20m out from the previous breached
   fence not 20m out from the vehicle's position.  This means if you
   choose to override the fence you may have less than 20m to regain
   vehicle control before the fence switches the vehicle to the :ref:`FENCE_ACTION<FENCE_ACTION>`
   again.  If you really want to override the fence, you should be ready
   to switch the flight mode twice or alternatively set-up the
   enable/disable fence switch.
