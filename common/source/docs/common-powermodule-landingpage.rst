Battery Monitors (aka Power Monitors/Modules)
=============================================

The links below have information about the most commonly used power monitors/modules

Up to 10 batteries/power monitors can be monitored. Each monitor has its own group of configuration parameters, designated by ``BATTx_`` with x denoting each monitor in the system (first monitor "x" is null character, ie ``BATT_`` prefix). In addition, a ``BATT_MONITOR`` "type" = SUM is available, that consolidates all following (higher numbered) battery monitors into a single report.

Power Monitors/Modules provide these benefits:

- Most provide a stable power supply to the autopilot, in addition to monitoring, and therefore reduces the chance of a brown-out
- Allows real-time monitoring of the batteryâ€™s voltage and current and triggering a low battery failsafe
- Allows compensating for the interference on the compass from the motors using the COMPASS_MOT_x and COMPASS_PMOT_x parameters, see :ref:`common-compass-setup-advanced` .
