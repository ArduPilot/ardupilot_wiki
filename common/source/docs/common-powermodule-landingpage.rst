The links below have information about the most commonly used power monitors/modules

.. note:: In firmware versions 4.0 and later, up to 10 batteries can be monitored. In addition, a new battery "type" = SUM, that consolidates all following (higher numbered) battery monitors into a single report, has been added to each monitor.

Power modules provide these benefits:

- Provides a stable power supply to the autopilot and reduces the chance of a brown-out
- Allows real-time monitoring of the batteryâ€™s voltage and current and triggering a low battery failsafe
- Allows compensating for the interference on the compass from the motors using the COMPASS_MOT_x and COMPASS_PMOT_x parameters, see :ref:`common-compass-setup-advanced` .
