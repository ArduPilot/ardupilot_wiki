Ground Control Stations
=======================

Ground Control Station (GCS) software provides a means to configure your autopilot system as well as providing an in-flight means of monitoring and controlling all aspects of the vehicle operation. If a radio control (RC) system is used with the vehicle, a GCS is not strictly required for flight and many operation aspects of the vehicle.

.. note:: operation without an RC system is possible but not preferred. Having such a system as a back control method is highly recommended, even if operation via GCS is the primary goal.
