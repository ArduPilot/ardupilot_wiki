Default UART order
==================

- SERIAL0 = console = USB
- SERIAL1 = Telemetry1 = USART1 (DMA capable)
- SERIAL2 = RCinput = USART2 (RX2 connected to SBUS via inverter, to use as UART input use :ref:`BRD_ALT_CONFIG<BRD_ALT_CONFIG>` = 1 and do not attach anything to SBUS pin)
- SERIAL3 = GPS1 = USART3
- SERIAL4 = GPS2 = UART4
- SERIAL5 = USER = UART5 (typically used for DJI Goggles (see :ref:`common-msp-osd-overview-4.2`) or Tramp VTX control (see :ref:`common-vtx`))
- SERIAL6 = USER = USART6 (solder pads)


Serial protocols shown are defaults, but can be adjusted to personal preferences.

Dshot capability
================

All motor/servo outputs are Dshot and PWM capable. However, mixing Dshot and normal PWM operation for outputs is restricted into groups, ie. enabling Dshot for an output in a group requires that ALL outputs in that group be configured and used as Dshot, rather than PWM outputs. The output groups that must be the same (PWM rate or Dshot, when configured as a normal servo/motor output) are: 1/2, 3/4/8, 5/6/7, 8, and 9 (LED).

.. note:: PWM9 is marked as "LED"

RC Input
========

The SBUS pin, is passed by an inverter to RX2 (UART2 RX), which by default is mapped to a timer input instead of the UART, and can be used for all ArduPilot supported receiver protocols, except CRSF/ELRS and SRXL2 which require a true UART connection. However, FPort, when connected in this manner, can provide RC without telemetry. 

To allow CRSF and embedded telemetry available in Fport, CRSF, and SRXL2 receivers, the RX2 pin can also be configured to be used as true UART2 RX pin for use with bi-directional systems by setting the :ref:`BRD_ALT_CONFIG<BRD_ALT_CONFIG>` to “1” so it becomes the SERIAL7 port's RX input pin.

With this option, :ref:`SERIAL2_PROTOCOL<SERIAL2_PROTOCOL>` must be set to "23", and:

- PPM is not supported.

- DSM/SRXL connects to the RX2  pin, but SBUS would still be connected to SBUS.

- FPort requires connection to TX2 and RX2 via a bi-directional inverter. See :ref:`common-FPort-receivers`.

- CRSF also requires a TX2 connection, in addition to RX2, and automatically provides telemetry.

- SRXL2 requires a connection to TX2 and automatically provides telemetry.  Set :ref:`SERIAL6_OPTIONS<SERIAL6_OPTIONS>` to "4".

Any UART can be used for RC system connections in ArduPilot also, and is compatible with all protocols except PPM (SBUS requires external inversion on other UARTs). See :ref:`common-rc-systems` for details.

.. note:: the 5v pin above the SBUS pin and the 5V pin in the GPS connector are powered when USB is connected. All other 5V pins are only powered when battery is present.

Battery Monitor Configuration
=============================
These settings are set as defaults when the firmware is loaded (except :ref:`BATT_AMP_PERVLT<BATT_AMP_PERVLT>` which needs to be changed from the default value). However, if they are ever lost, you can manually set the parameters:

Enable Battery monitor.

:ref:`BATT_MONITOR<BATT_MONITOR>` =4

Then reboot.

:ref:`BATT_VOLT_PIN<BATT_VOLT_PIN>` 12

:ref:`BATT_CURR_PIN<BATT_CURR_PIN>` 11

:ref:`BATT_VOLT_MULT<BATT_VOLT_MULT>` 11.08836

:ref:`BATT_AMP_PERVLT<BATT_AMP_PERVLT>` 30 

Connecting a GPS/Compass module
===============================

This board does not include a GPS or compass so an :ref:`external GPS/compass <common-positioning-landing-page>` should be connected as shown below in order for autonomous modes to function.

Firmware
========

Firmware for this board can be found `here <https://firmware.ardupilot.org>`_ in  sub-folders labeled
