==========================

The `Benewake TF02 lidar <http://en.benewake.com/product/detail/5c345c9de5b3a844c4723299.html>`__ has an indoor range of 22m, an outdoor range of 10m, an update rate of 100hz and weighs only 52g.

The `TF03 <http://en.benewake.com/product/detail/5c345cc2e5b3a844c472329a.html>`__ has a range of 50m to 180m (depending upon the surface) and weighs 77g.

More details on both these lidar can be found in the `benewake.com's downloads area <http://en.benewake.com/download>`__

Connecting to the Autopilot
-----------------------------------

For a serial connection you can use any spare Serial/UART port.  The diagram below shows how to connect to SERIAL4.

If the SERIAL4/5 port on a Pixhawk is being used then the following parameters should be set for the first rangefinder:

-  :ref:`SERIAL4_PROTOCOL <SERIAL4_PROTOCOL>` = 9 (Lidar)
-  :ref:`SERIAL4_BAUD <SERIAL4_BAUD>` = 115 (115200 baud)
-  :ref:`RNGFND1_TYPE <RNGFND1_TYPE>` = 19 (Benewake TF02) for TF02, =20 (Benewake-Serial) for TF03 if Copter 3.6.12, =27 (Benewake TF03) for TF03 for Copter 4.0 and later. Note: using type = 20 on a TF03 will restrict its maximum range to that of a TF02.
-  :ref:`RNGFND1_MIN_CM <RNGFND1_MIN_CM>` = 30
-  :ref:`RNGFND1_MAX_CM <RNGFND1_MAX_CM>`: for TF02 use **2000** for indoor, **1000** for outdoor.  For TF03 use **3500** for indoor, **12000** for outdoor.  *This is the distance in centimeters that the rangefinder can reliably read.*
-  :ref:`RNGFND1_GNDCLEAR <RNGFND1_GNDCLEAR>` = 10 *or more accurately the distance in centimetres from the range finder to the ground when the vehicle is landed.  This value depends on how you have mounted the rangefinder.*

If instead the Telem2 port was used then the serial parameters listed above should instead be:

-  :ref:`SERIAL2_PROTOCOL <SERIAL2_PROTOCOL>` = 9
-  :ref:`SERIAL2_BAUD <SERIAL2_BAUD>` = 115

Testing the sensor
==================

Distances read by the sensor can be seen in the Mission Planner's Flight
Data screen's Status tab. Look closely for "sonarrange".
