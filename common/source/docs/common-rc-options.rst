:ref:`RC_OPTIONS<RC_OPTIONS>` bitmask provides several options related to how RC inputs and overrides by the Ground Control Station (GCS) are handled, depending on which bits are set ("1"):

=================================       =========
:ref:`RC_OPTIONS<RC_OPTIONS>` bit       Function
=================================       =========
0                                       Ignores any attached RC receiver outputs
1                                       Ignores any RC overrides received from the GCS
2                                       Ignores receiver failsafe bit
3                                       Add delay bytes in FPort protocol, needed by some systems, see :ref:`FPort Setup<common-FPort-receivers>`
=================================       =========

for example, to set this option to ignore receiver failsafe bits, you would set bit 2, or a value of "4" (2^2=4). This may be usefull when using ground station control beyond the range of the RC system which can set its receiver's outputs to trim values upon RC signal loss, but still has a failsafe bit in the protocol which would otherwise force an RC failsafe to occur.
