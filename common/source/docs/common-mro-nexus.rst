Overview
========

The `mRo Nexus <https://store.mrobotics.io>`__ is a member of the next generation of mRobotics' family of Pixracer autopilots. It has been designed for ultra compact applications which primarily use CAN peripherals, as well as standard GPS/Compass or Airspeed sensors. It includes an integrated ADS-B receiver for avoidance.


.. tip::

   At time of writing the autopilot is still being evolved/improved.
   The final version may very slightly from the information provided
   here.
