The PixC4-Jetson is a professional-quality and NDAA Compliant Flight Management Unit (FMU), powerful single board computer and peripheral support system (USB, MIPI, Ethernet, M.2 slot, etc.) in a small form factor, designed to be integrated into end-user platforms. The term “PixC4” is derived from the Pixhawk, on which the FMU design is based (FMUv5) and C4, representing Command, Control, Compute and Communication.

Available as a turnkey solution including software pre-flashed on the Nvidia Jetson companion computer to enable the following features:

- UDP Unicast/Multicast/Broadcast Telemetry (MAVLink)
- LTE connection management with Layer-2 peer to peer VPN
- Powerful multi-endpoint video encoding pipelines with example/open-source scripts for customization
- `ATAK <https://www.civtak.org/>`__ Integration
- Web interface for configuration and remote terminal access
- Supports multiple simultaneous communication pathways such as LOS, LTE and Satcom with advanced stale command rejection and message deduplication
- Scalable and secure cloud connectivity to Horizon31's US servers and optional access to their cloud GCS and low-latency webRTC video distribution system (https://gcs.horizon31.com)
