Downloading and Analyzing Data Logs in Mission Planner
======================================================

:ref:`Dataflash logs <common-downloading-and-analyzing-data-logs-in-mission-planner>`
are stored on the Pixhawk (or APM2.x) onboard dataflash memory and can
be download after a flight. On Plane and Rover dataflash logs are
created soon after start-up. On Copter they are created after you first
arm the copter. This topic explains how to configure and access
Dataflash logs.

[copywiki destination="copter,plane,rover,planner"]

.. note::

   :ref:`Telemetry logs <common-mission-planner-telemetry-logs>` (also
   known as "tlogs") collect similar information to dataflash logs (see
   :ref:`Diagnosing problems using Logs <common-diagnosing-problems-using-logs>` for more information).

Downloading logs via MAVLink
============================

This method is available in AC3.2 (or higher).

-  Connect your vehicle to the mission planner using the micro USB cable
-  Open the Mission Planner's Flight Data screen
-  On the bottom left, select the "DataFlash Logs" tab and push the
   "Download DataFlash Log Via Mavlink" button

.. image:: ../../../images/Capture3.png
    :target: ../_images/Capture3.png

.. image:: ../../../images/Capture3.png
    :target: ../_images/Capture3.png

Then, select the log you want to download. This will save that log to
your MissionPlanner/logs directory, in a folder named after the vehicle
type, such as QUADCOPTER.

Automatic Analysis of logs
==========================

.. figure:: ../../../images/MissionPlanner_AutomaticLogAnalysis_Buttons.png
   :target: ../_images/MissionPlanner_AutomaticLogAnalysis_Buttons.png

   Mission Planner: Start LogAnalysis

The simplest analysis is to generate a basic automated report that will
highlight common problem areas. For that, click on "Log Analysis"
and select a log that you've already saved to the MissionPlanner/logs
directory.  They will be in folders named after the vehicle type, such
as QUADCOPTER or ROVER. Once you pick the log you want, it will generate
a report that looks like this:

.. image:: ../../../images/Capture3.png
    :target: ../_images/Capture3.png

Manually review a log
=====================

For more detailed analysis, click on "Review a Log" and select a log
that you've already saved to the MissionPlanner/logs directory.  Once
again, they will be in folders named after the vehicle type, such as
QUADCOPTER or ROVER. Once you pick the log you want, you will get charts
such as the below. The basic format of the dataflash is:

-  Line numbers appear on the very left side of the viewer
-  Software version and board type appear at the top
-  FMT messages are next which tell the mission planner the column
   headers for each message type
-  PARM rows which show each parameter (in the order in which they
   appear in the eeprom) along with their value at the beginning of the
   flight
-  Flight data messages including GPS, IMU, etc.

.. image:: ../../../images/mp_dataflash_format.png
    :target: ../_images/mp_dataflash_format.png

Graph any flight data by first clicking on the appropriate row, you
should see the column headers update appropriately. Next find the column
you wish to graph, click on it and then push the "Graph this data"
button. In the example above the ATT's Roll-In and Roll data have been
graphed. The mouse's scroll wheel can be used to zoom in or out. You may
also select an area of the graph to zoom in on it. Zoom out by
right-mouse-button clicking and selecting "Set Scale to Default".
`Here's <http://www.diydrones.com/profiles/blog/show?id=705844%3ABlogPost%3A801607>`__
a mini tutorial on using this feature. You may also filter on just the
first column (the flight data message type) by clicking on the first
column and selecting the message type from the drop-down. This is very
useful especially for viewing the different flight modes (called "MODE"
messages) used during the mission. Click the first column again but
press "Cancel" to clear the filter.

Setting what data you want recorded
===================================

The LOG_BITMASK parameter controls what message types are recorded in
the dataflash.  Recent versions of the mission planner and ardupilot
allow individual messages to be enabled/disabled from the MP's
Config/Tuning, Standard Params screen.

.. image:: ../../../images/mp_dataflash_log_bitmask.png
    :target: ../_images/mp_dataflash_log_bitmask.png

Earlier versions of MP/ardupilot allow selecting the message using a
drop-down as shown below.

Viewing KMZ FILES
=================

When you download the dataflash log files from the APM/PX4 it will
automatically create a KMZ file (file with extension .kmz). This file
can be opened with Google Earth (just double click the file) to view
your flight in Google Earth. Please see the instructions on the
:ref:`Telemetry Logs Page <common-mission-planner-telemetry-logs_creating_3d_images_of_the_flight_path>`
for additional details.
