GEM1305 RTK receiver with antenna
==================================
GEM1305 is a RTK receiver with antenna designed and manufactured by `DATAGNSS <https://www.datagnss.com/>`__. 

GEM1305 is based on the new generation Allystar dual-core GNSS SoC. It supports RTK functionality with a maximum data update rate of 5Hz.

The board is connected to the autopilot via UART interface.

.. image:: ../../../images/gem1305/GEM1305-connector.png
    :target: ../_images/gem1305/GEM1305-connector.png

The 1.25mm pitch 6P connector (from Left PIN1 to PIN6) :

   -  1: GND
   -  2: NC
   -  3: PPS
   -  4: Rx
   -  5: Tx
   -  6: 5V

Please note that the board only includes RTK and doesn't include compass.

If using the GEM1305 with a case, you can directly insert the connector into the GPS2 port.

ArduPilot Setup
===============
For example, if GEM1305 is connected to the autopilot's SERIAL4 port, set:

- :ref:`SERIAL4_PROTOCOL <SERIAL4_PROTOCOL>` = 5

Configuration
=============
RTK technology can greatly improve the accuracy of positioning.

RTK technology requires a base and a rover, with the base placed on the ground, which is referred to as the rover on the drone.The data from the base needs to be transmitted to the drone via telemetry radio and inputted into the RTK receiver on the rover.

Base station setup
==================
We suggest using the NANO RTK Receiver as the configuration for the base station(ground base station), which is more convenient and user-friendly.

- Connect the NANO RTK Receiver to your Laptop via USB.

Setup the NANO RTK Receiver as a base station, and it is recommended to use Satrack software.

- `Download Satrack <https://wiki.datagnss.com/images/e/ee/Satrack.zip>`_

1. Open Satrack, then choose the com port, baud rate then connect the nano-rtk-rcv.

   .. image:: ../../../images/gem1305/satrack-connect-device.png
      :target: ../_images/gem1305/satrack-connect-device.png

2. Enable RTCMv3 output

   .. image:: ../../../images/gem1305/satrack-rtcm-output.png
      :target: ../_images/gem1305/satrack-rtcm-output.png

3. Disable NMEA data output

   .. image:: ../../../images/gem1305/satrack-disable-nmea.png
      :target: ../_images/gem1305/satrack-disable-nmea.png

4. Config output rate to 1Hz

   In base station mode, the RTCM data output rate must be set to 1Hz.

   .. image:: ../../../images/gem1305/satrack-outputrate-1hz.png
      :target: ../_images/gem1305/satrack-outputrate-1hz.png

5. Config the base station fixed coordinates

   There are two methods to set the coordinates of the base station:

   5.1 According to the diagram below, Input the known coordinates.

   Press ``Get now``, and modify the coordinates to the known values, then ``Send`` to apply the fixed coordinates.

   .. image:: ../../../images/gem1305/satrack-cfg-fixedecef.png
       :target: ../_images/gem1305/satrack-cfg-fixedecef.png

   5.2 or, using the ``CFG-SURVEY`` meassage, config ``miniDuration`` and ``AccLimit``, then automatically calculate the average before proceeding with the setup.

   .. image:: ../../../images/gem1305/satrack-cfg-survey.png
       :target: ../_images/gem1305/satrack-cfg-survey.png

   After completing the above operation, you can save the current configuration with ``CFG-SAVE`` message. 

6. After completing the above configuration, open Mission Planner and finish the configuration on this page:

    :target: ../_images/gem1305/mp-connect-base.png

Rover station (Aircraft) setup
==============================
For vehicles, NANO RTK Receiver or GEM1305 can be chosen as the Rover for RTK.

Whether you choose NANO RTK Receiver or GEM1305, you need to confirm in the Satrack software that all RTCM data outputs are disabled and all NMEA outputs are enabled.

In Rover mode, the output rate must be set to 5Hz.

.. note:: NANO RTK Receiver and GEM1305 do not support safety switch, so :ref:`BRD_SAFETY_DEFLT<BRD_SAFETY_DEFLT>` needs to be set to 0 or a separate safety switch should be connected to the flight controller.

After completing the above settings, you can write parameters to the flight controller.
