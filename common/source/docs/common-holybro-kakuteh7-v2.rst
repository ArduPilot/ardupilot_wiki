UART Mapping
============

The UARTs are marked Rn and Tn in the above pinouts. The Rn pin is the
receive pin for UARTn. The Tn pin is the transmit pin for UARTn.

   -  SERIAL0 -> USB
   -  SERIAL1 -> UART1 (Telem1) DMA-enabled
   -  SERIAL2 -> not available externally, internally connected to currently unsupported BT-LE module
   -  SERIAL3 -> UART3 (SmartAudio VTX protocol by default)
   -  SERIAL4 -> UART4 (GPS) DMA-enabled
   -  SERIAL5 -> not available
   -  SERIAL6 -> UART6 (Setup for serial RX Protocol SBUS by default) DMA-enabled
   -  SERIAL7 -> UART7 (RX7 only available, normally used for ESC telemetry protocol by default)

The SERIAL7 port (UART7) is normally for ESC telemetry, and has an R7 pin on
both of the ESC connectors.

Any UART may be re-tasked by changing its protocol parameter.

Copter Default Frame Type
=========================

For Copter firmware the FRAME_TYPE is already defaulted to type "12" (BetaFlight X) allowing existing BetaFlight configurations with ESCs attached to have the correct motor ordering without changes to the FRAME_TYPE and FRAME_CLASS parameters or ESC wiring.

RC Input
========

RC input is configured on the R6 (UART6_RX) pin. It supports all RC protocols except PPM. See :ref:`common-rc-systems` for details for a specific RC system. :ref:`SERIAL6_PROTOCOL<SERIAL6_PROTOCOL>` is set to "23", by default, to enable this.

- SBUS/DSM/SRXL connects to the R6 pin.

- FPort requires connection to T6 and :ref:`SERIAL6_OPTIONS<SERIAL6_OPTIONS>` be set to "7".

- CRSF also requires a T6 connection, in addition to R6, and automatically provides telemetry. Set :ref:`SERIAL6_OPTIONS<SERIAL6_OPTIONS>` to "0".

- SRXL2 requires a connecton to T6 and automatically provides telemetry.  Set :ref:`SERIAL6_OPTIONS<SERIAL6_OPTIONS>` to "4".

Any UART can be used for RC system connections in ArduPilot also, and is compatible with all protocols except PPM. See :ref:`common-rc-systems` for details.

FrSky Telemetry
===============

FrSky Telemetry is supported using the Tx pin of any UART. You need to set the following parameters to enable support for FrSky S.PORT (example shows SERIAL2).

  - :ref:`SERIAL2_PROTOCOL<SERIAL2_PROTOCOL>` 10
  - :ref:`SERIAL2_OPTIONS<SERIAL2_OPTIONS>` 7

OSD Support
===========

The KakuteH7  supports OSD using :ref:`OSD_TYPE<OSD_TYPE>` 1 (MAX7456 driver). The defaults are also setup to allow DJI Goggle OSD support on UART1.

PWM Output
==========

The KakuteH7 supports up to 8 PWM outputs. Outputs are available via two JST-SH connectors. All 8 outputs support DShot and bi-directional DShot, as well as all PWM types.

The PWM is in 3 groups:

 - PWM 1, 2 in group1
 - PWM 3, 4 in group2
 - PWM 5, 6 in group3
 - PWM 7, 8 in group4
 - PWM 9 (LED) in group5

Channels within the same group need to use the same output rate, whether PWM or Dshot. If
any channel in a group uses DShot then all channels in the group need
to use DShot.

LED Output
==========

The LED output is configured by default to support :ref:`NeoPixel LED strings<common-serial-led-neopixel>`.

Battery Monitoring
==================

The board has a built-in voltage sensor via the B+ pin, but no internal current sensor. An external current sensor can be connected to the CUR pin. Default parameters for both internal voltage and external current monitoring are set by default to the below for use with any Holybro Tekko32 F4 4in1 ESC.

The correct battery setting parameters are:

 - :ref:`BATT_MONITOR<BATT_MONITOR>` 4
 - :ref:`BATT_VOLT_PIN<BATT_VOLT_PIN>` 10
 - :ref:`BATT_CURR_PIN<BATT_CURR_PIN>` 11
 - :ref:`BATT_VOLT_MULT<BATT_VOLT_MULT>` 10.1
 - :ref:`BATT_AMP_PERVLT<BATT_AMP_PERVLT>` varies depending on external current sensor

Compass
=======

The KakuteH7 V2 does not have a built-in compass, however you can attach an external compass using I2C on the SDA and SCL pads.

Firmware
========

Firmware for this board can be found `here <https://firmware.ardupilot.org>`_ in  sub-folders labeled "KakuteH7v2".

Loading Firmware
================

Initial firmware load can be done with DFU by plugging in USB with the
bootloader button pressed. Then you should load the "with_bl.hex"
firmware, using your favourite DFU loading tool.

Once the initial firmware is loaded you can update the firmware using
any ArduPilot ground station software. Later updates should be done with the
\*.apj firmware files.
