Acknowledgements
================

The project is the result of an immense amount of effort from software and hardware engineers, testers, web developers, documenters and many others.

These days ArduPilot is financially supported by our `Partners <https://ardupilot.org/about/Partners>`__ and :ref:`individuals <common-donation>` but in the early days when ArduPilot was still growing up it was primarily `3DR <https://3dr.com/>`__ (a.k.a. "3DRobotics") that provided support.  This sponsorship paid the salaries of some of the core development team, hosting infrastructure for the project websites, and provided hardware as needed.  Thanks 3DR!

We also want to acknowledge `Helpmonks <https://helpmonks.com>`__ for providing their Bliss plan free of cost. Managing e-mail in ArduPilot's team is now easier.
