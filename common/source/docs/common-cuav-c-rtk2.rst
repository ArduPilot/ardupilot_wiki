C-RTK 2 PPK Module
==================

C-RTK 2 is a high-performance PPK/RTK positioning module created by CUAV for professional applications such as drone aerial survey/mapping). Its small shape/light weight, industrial-grade IMU combination, and combination of high-precision positioning modules can easily satisfy the most demanding Copter/VTOL Plane/Traditional Helicopter applications.
