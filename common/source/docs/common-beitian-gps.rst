.. note:: Small GPS modules with small backplanes, such as the BN-220, may take a long time to acquire sufficient stability of their velocity and position lock to allow pre-arm checks to pass when using EKF3 in Plane or EKF2 or EKF3 in Copter. Solutions are to either wait however long it takes for pre-arm checks to clear, increase the effective size of the ground plane by putting a larger square of aluminum foil behind the GPS (be careful not to short anything, insulating it from the GSP electronics!), or increase the value of the ``EKFx_CHECK_SCALE`` which controls the tightness of the pre-arm consistency checks to 120 to 150 (this is NOT recommended for Copter).
