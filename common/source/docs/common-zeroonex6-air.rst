UART Mapping
============
The UARTs are marked Rn and Tn in the above pinouts. The Rn pin is the receive pin for UARTn. The Tn pin is the transmit pin for UARTn.

RC Input
========
The SBUS pin, can be used for all ArduPilot supported receiver protocols, except CRSF/ELRS and SRXL2 which require a true UART connection. However, FPort, when connected in this manner, will only provide RC without telemetry.

To allow CRSF and embedded telemetry available in Fport, CRSF, and SRXL2 receivers, a full UART, such as SERIAL6 (UART4) would need to be used for receiver connections. Below are setups using Serial6.


* :ref:`SERIAL6_PROTOCOL<SERIAL6_PROTOCOL>` should be set to "23".
* FPort would require :ref:`SERIAL6_OPTIONS<SERIAL6_OPTIONS>` be set to "15".
* CRSF/ELRS would require :ref:`SERIAL6_OPTIONS<SERIAL6_OPTIONS>` be set to "0".
* SRXL2 would require :ref:`SERIAL6_OPTIONS<SERIAL6_OPTIONS>` be set to "4" and connects only the TX pin.


Any UART can be used for RC system connections in ArduPilot also, and is compatible with all protocols except PPM. See :ref:`common-rc-systems` for details.

PWM Output
==========
The X6_Air flight controller supports up to 15 PWM outputs.The first 8 outputs (labelled M1 to M8) are controlled by a dedicated STM32F103 IO controller. The remaining 7 outputs (labelled A9 to A15) are the "auxiliary" outputs. These are directly attached to the STM32H753 FMU controller.

All 15 outputs support normal PWM output formats. All outputs support DShot, except A15. Outputs 1-12 support Bi_Directional DShot.

The M1-8 outputs are in 4 groups:


* Outputs 1 and 2 in group1
* Outputs 3 and 4 in group2
* Outputs 5, 6, 7 and 8 in group3

The A9-15 outputs are in 4 groups:


* Outputs 9 - 12 in group1
* Outputs 13 and 14 in group2
* Outputs 15 in group3

Channels within the same group need to use the same output rate. If any channel in a group uses DShot then all channels in the group need to use DShot.

GPIO
====
All PWM outputs can be used as GPIOs (relays, camera, RPM etc). To use them you need to set the outputâ€™s ``SERVOx_FUNCTION`` to -1. The numbering of the GPIOs for PIN variables in ArduPilot is:

       ====     =====     ====      =====
       Name     Value     Name      Value
       ====     =====     ====      =====
       M1       101       A9        50
       M2       102       A10       51
       M3       103       A11       52
       M4       104       A12       53
       M5       105       A13       54
       M6       106       A14       55
       M7       107       A15       56
       M8       108 
       ====     =====     ====      =====

Battery Monitoring
==================
The X6_Air flight controller has one six-pin power connector, supporting a CAN interface power supply on CAN bus 1.

The autopilot defaults are setup for CAN Power Module use (normally supplied with autopilot):


* :ref:`BATT_MONITOR<BATT_MONITOR>` = 8
* :ref:`CAN_P1_DRIVER<CAN_P1_DRIVER>` = 1
* :ref:`CAN_D1_PROTOCOL<CAN_D1_PROTOCOL>` = 1

Compass
=======
The X6_Air flight controller has a built-in industrial-grade electronic compass chip IST8310. Due to potential interference, the autopilot is usually used with an external I2C compass as
part of a GPS/Compass combination.

Analog inputs
=============
The X6_Air flight controller has 2 analog inputs.

* ADC Pin12 -> ADC 6.6V Sense
* ADC Pin13 -> ADC 3.3V Sense

Loading Firmware
================

The board comes pre-installed with an ArduPilot compatible bootloader,
allowing the loading of xxxxxx.apj firmware files with any ArduPilot
compatible ground station.

Firmware for these boards can be found `here <https://firmware.ardupilot.org>`_ in  sub-folders labeled "ZeroOne_Air".
