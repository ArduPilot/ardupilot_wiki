===========================
Items in Master Branch Only
===========================

This lists features or changes merged in master and build in the "latest" firmware, but not in a stable or beta release yet. They have passed all test suites and usually have already been flight tested. These items are considered in the broad flight testing stage and test users are encouraged. Eventually, they will released in a beta, then stable release.

.. note:: Currently firmware is in the 4.1 beta stage so all features are in the wiki now. Once firmware is released as Stable, new items will start to accumulate on this page for a future release.
