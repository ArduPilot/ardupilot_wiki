Tips on mounting the GPS module
===============================

-  For modules without an on-board compass, the orientation does not
   matter as long as the square antenna side is facing up
-  The GPS should have a clear view of the sky and not be under spinning
   propellers
-  It should be mounted as far away as possible from radio transmission
   equipment (telemetry, video transmitters), motors, and ESCs.
