TBS Crossfire Telemetry
=======================


TBS CRSF Receivers incorporate telemetry along with RC control information in their interface to ArduPilot. ArduPilot supports native CRSF telemetry and extensions to it that allow using the :Ref:`common-frsky-yaapu`. See :ref:`common-tbs-rc` for connection and setup information.

OpenTx will discover the native CRSF Telemetry sensors, which then can be displayed on `OpenTX <https://www.open-tx.org/>`_ telemetry screens or repeated from the CRSF TX module's WIFI to MAVLink Ground Control Stations:

These values can be displayed on OpenTX transmitters in several ways:

- Using the built-in telemetry screens:

In addition, by setting :ref:`RC_OPTIONS<RC_OPTIONS>` bit 8,
additional ArduPilot telemetry items are transferred which allows use of the :ref:`common-frsky-yaapu` on OpenTX transmitters. Limitations and additional information is shown `here <https://discuss.ardupilot.org/t/passthrough-telemetry-over-crsf-crossfire>`__.

.. warning:: when using :ref:`RC_OPTIONS<RC_OPTIONS>` bit 8 for passthru, be sure no SERIAL port is setup to use ``SERIALx_PROTOCOL`` = 10 (Passthrough) to avoid a conflict and unreliable operation.

Several OpenTX scripts are normally provided for adjusting CRSF TX and RX system parameters. They are accessed by long pressing the SYS button.

ArduPilot Parameter Editor
==========================

In  addition, the ArduPilot CRSF implementation provides for ArduPilot parameter adjustment, similar in function to ArduPilot's :ref:`common-paramosd` feature.

If the autopilot has an active integrated OSD, this feature is automatically enabled. If not, then selecting :ref:`OSD_TYPE<OSD_TYPE>` = 4 (TX only) will enable it.

Selecting the Crossfire Configuration LUA script in the transmitter will show:

And selecting the ArduPilot vehicle shown in that list will activate the :ref:`common-paramosd` with a list of all parameters which have been setup for both OSD screens.

.. note:: Some autopilots will not display the parameter values that have text names, as text, but rather as a number, in order to save flash space. See  :ref:`common-limited_firmware` for those without CRSF TEXT capability.
