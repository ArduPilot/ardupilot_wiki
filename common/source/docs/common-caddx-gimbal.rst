Connect the gimbal's RX, TX and GND pins to one of the autopilot's serial ports as shown above

Connect with a ground station and set the following parameters.  The params below assume the autopilot's telem2 port is used

- :ref:`SERIAL2_PROTOCOL <SERIAL2_PROTOCOL>` to 8 ("Gimbal")
- :ref:`SERIAL2_BAUD <SERIAL2_BAUD>` to "115" for 115200 bps
- :ref:`MNT1_TYPE <MNT1_TYPE>` to "13" ("CADDX") and reboot the autopilot
- :ref:`MNT1_PITCH_MIN <MNT1_PITCH_MIN>` to -90
- :ref:`MNT1_PITCH_MAX <MNT1_PITCH_MAX>` to 90
- :ref:`MNT1_YAW_MIN <MNT1_YAW_MIN>` to -170
- :ref:`MNT1_YAW_MAX <MNT1_YAW_MAX>` to 170
- :ref:`MNT1_RC_RATE <MNT1_RC_RATE>` to 60 (deg/s) to control speed of gimbal when using RC targetting
- :ref:`RC6_OPTION <RC6_OPTION>` = 213 ("Mount Pitch") to control the gimbal's pitch angle with RC channel 6
- :ref:`RC7_OPTION <RC7_OPTION>` = 214 ("Mount Yaw") to control the gimbal's yaw angle with RC channel 7
- :ref:`RC8_OPTION <RC8_OPTION>` = 163 ("Mount Lock") to switch between "lock" and "follow" mode with RC channel 8
