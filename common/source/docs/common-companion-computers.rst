Companion Computers
===================

Overview
========

Companion Computers travel on the vehicle and communicate with (and
control) the autopilot. The Companion Computer gets all the
MAVLink data produced by the autopilot (including GPS data) and can use
it to make intelligent decisions during flight. This enables a broad
range of functionality, from computer mediated flight paths, though to
very CPU intensive functionality such as vision processing.

.. note::

   The term "Companion Computer" is typically taken to mean an
   on-board Linux-based computer that communicates with the 
   autopilot over a fast link using MAVLink messages.

   Using a Companion Computer is an alternative to using a fully integrated
   Linux autopilot.

See :ref:`Companion Computers <dev:companion-computers>` for specific documentation.
