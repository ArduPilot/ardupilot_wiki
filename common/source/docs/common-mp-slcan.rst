Mission Planner SLCAN
=====================

SLCAN tool inside Mission Planner allows viewing, configuration and software updates of nodes
connected to the CANBUS port of the flight controller.

Before the autopilot can be connected to Mission Planner using SLCAN, parameters have to be configured. See :ref:`common-slcan-f4` or :ref:`common-slcan-f7h7` for setup information. If Mission Planner is in the disconnected state, make sure the SLCAN port is shown as the selected COM port in the drop down box in the upper right corner of Mission Planner.

In Mission Planner, navigate to Initial Setup->Optional Hardware->UAVCAN(DroneCAN)
click on the highlighted red button.

DroneCAN nodes connected.

If the node has bootloader only installed, then firmware will need to be
uploaded. ``MAINTENANCE`` will be displayed. Click on update firmware. Firmware can be found `here <https://firmware.ardupilot.org/AP_Periph/>`__ and downloaded for the node.

downloaded and select it.
