Accelerometer Calibration in Mission Planner
============================================

[copywiki destination="copter,plane,rover,planner"]

This article shows how to perform basic accelerometer calibration (using
*Mission Planner*).

.. note::

   Accelerometer calibration is mandatory if you're :ref:`using EKF to estimate vehicle position <common-apm-navigation-extended-kalman-filter-overview>`.

Calibration steps
=================

#. Under **Initial Setup \| Mandatory Hardware**, select **Accel
   Calibration** from the left-side menu.

      Mission Planner: Calibrate Acceleration

#. Click **Calibrate Accel** to start the calibration.

   *Mission Planner* will prompt you to place the vehicle each
   calibration position. Press any key to indicate that the autopilot is
   in position and then proceed to the next orientation.

   The calibration positions are: level, on right side, left side, nose
   down, nose up and on its back.

   .. tip::

         -  It is important that the vehicle is kept still immediately after
            pressing the key for each step.
         -  You may need to calibrate the board before it is mounted if the
            size/shape of the vehicle makes this difficult.
         -  The level position is the most important to get right as this will
            be the attitude that your controller considers level while flying.

#. Proceed through the required positions (it is not necessary to use
   the **Click When Done** button).

      Mission Planner: Accel Calibration - press any key

#. When you've completed the calibration process, Mission Planner will
   display "Calibration Successful!" as shown below.

Video demonstration (Copter)
============================

Video demonstration of accelerometer calibration. This is for an older
version of Copter/Mission Planner, but is useful as an example of how
you might hold a Copter.
