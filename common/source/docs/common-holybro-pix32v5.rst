System Features
===============

HolyBro Pix32 v5 is a new flight controller developed on the base of FMUv5
scheme, which can be regarded as a variant version of 'Pixhawk4'.

The Pix32 v5 is comprised of a separate flight controller and carrier board which are
connected by a 100pin connector. It is designed for those pilots who need a high power,
flexible and customizable flight control system.

Manufacturers can design  carrier boards to suit their specific needs.
