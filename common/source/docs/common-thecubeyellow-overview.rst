System Features
===============

The Cube Yellow autopilot is new model in the Cubepilot ecosystem, designed for hobby users, commercial system integrators and UAS manufacturers the Cube Yellow is based on the Arm STM32F7 series SOC. Sitting directly between the Cube Black and Orange the this model offers better preference and newer sensors over the Cube Black while retaining F series SOC compatibility. 

Just like the other models the Yellow is part of a wide ecosystem of autopilot modules and carrier boards. Because all Cube models are compatible with all carriers this allows users to choose an off the shelf carrier board that best suits their needs. System designers are able to integrate the Cube directly into their designs via published carrier board specifications. 


Cube Yellow Features
====================

-  Faster F7 SOC with 512KB ram
-  Upgraded tripple redundant IMU sensors for extra redundancy
-  2 sets of IMU are vibration-isolated mechanically, reducing the effect of frame vibration to state estimation
-  IMUs are temperature-controlled by onboard heating resistors, allowing optimum working temperature of IMUs
-  The entire flight management unit(FMU) and inertial management unit(IMU) are housed in a reatively small form factor (a cube). 
-  Fully Cubepilot carrierboard compatible, all inputs and outputs go through a 80-pin DF17 connector, allowing a plug-in solution for manufacturers of commercial systems. Manufacturers can design their own carrier boards to suite their specific needs now and in the future.

Carrier Board Design
====================

The reference design files of the standard carrier board are available in `github  <https://github.com/proficnc/The-Cube>`__, or `here <https://github.com/ArduPilot/Schematics/tree/master/ProfiCNC>`__ ,this serve as a starting point for designers to design their own system based on The Cube autopilot.
