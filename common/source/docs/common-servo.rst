Servo
=====

Copter, Plane and Rover can control servos for any purpose, including:
triggering a camera shutter, releasing a parachute or dropping a tennis
ball.  These servo(s) can be controlled either directly by the pilot via
a switch on the transmitter, through commands sent from the ground
station or as part of a mission.

or `digital servos <https://www.amazon.com/Hitec-RCD-35076S-HS-A5076HB-Digital/dp/B003RXHMNK>`__
may be used.

Connecting the servo to a Pixhawk
=================================

-  If using Copter Connect the servo to AUX OUT 1, 2, 3 or 4.  MAIN OUT
   1 ~ 8 should be avoided because these update at 400hz.
-  If using Plane or Rover where all pins update at 50hz, any unused
   MAIN OUT or AUX OUT 1 ~ 4 may be used.
-  AUX OUT 5 and 6 cannot be used by default because they are setup as
   :ref:`Relays <common-relay>`.  These pins can changed to Servo
   outputs by setting the ``BRD_PWM_COUNT`` parameter to 6 and setting
   :ref:`RELAY_PIN<RELAY_PIN>` and :ref:`RELAY_PIN2<RELAY_PIN2>` to -1.
-  The Pixhawk autopilot cannot provide power to the servos so
   an external BEC or ESC that can provide 5V should be used.

.. note:: in firmware versions 4.2 and later, the method for setting a PWM/SERVO/MOTOR outputs to be a GPIO function is changed. Instead of ``BRD_PWM_COUNT`` being used, the individual ``SERVOx_FUNCTION`` parameter is merely set to "-1". If set to "0", it remains a PWM output, unassigned to a function, and outputs that output's trim value when board safety is not active. If the servo function is being "mirrored" to a remote device, as in the case of a DroneCAN or KDECAN ESC, then in order to change the autopilot board's corresponding output pin to be a GPIO, but allow the ``SERVOx_FUNCTION`` to still be assigned to the remote device, the :ref:`SERVO_GPIO_MASK<SERVO_GPIO_MASK>` parameter can be used to assign the board pin to be a GPIO without affecting the ``SERVOx_FUNCTION`` assignment for the remote device.

Controlling the servo as a camera shutter
=========================================

Details on how to set-up and control the servo as if it were triggering
the shutter of a camera can be found  :ref:`here on the Camera Gimbal wiki page <copter:common-camera-gimbal>`.  The 
advantage of this set-up is:

-  the servo can be triggered from the ch7 or ch8 auxiliary switch on
   Copter
-  if you wish the servo to move to one position, delay for a moment
   then return to its original position this can all be accomplished
   with a single mission command
-  the location and attitude of the copter will be recorded to the
   dataflash each time the servo is triggered

The disadvantage of using the camera shutter method is the servo can
only be moved to two pre-configured positions.

Controlling the servo as a servo
================================

The traditional way to control a servo only works as part of a mission
(i.e. AUTO mode).  Follow these instructions:

-  Connect to your autopilot from the ground station
-  On the Config/Tuning > Full Parameter List page, ensure that the SERVOx_FUNCTION (or RCx_FUNCTION) is set to zero for the servo (i.e. :ref:`SERVO9_FUNCTION <SERVO9_FUNCTION>` = 0 if the servo is connected a Pixhawks AUX OUT2).
-  Press the Write Params button

-  Create the mission you wish to fly and add a DO_SET_SERVO command
   and include the servo number (i.e. "10") in the "Ser No" field and
   the PWM value (usually between 1000 ~ 2000) in the "PWM" field.

Note that the DO_SET_SERVO command is a "do command" meaning that it
can only be run between waypoints so it must not be the first or last
command in the mission.  It will be executed immediately after the
waypoint that precedes it.

Testing with the Mission Planner
================================

The mission planner's Flight Data screen includes a "Servo" tab on the
bottom right that can be used to test that the servos are moving
correctly.
