Using the IMU BatchSampler
==========================

The IMU BatchSampler can be used to record high-frequency data from the IMU sensors onboard an ArduPilot vehicle.

This data can be used in post-flight analysis to characterise vibration issues, most notably through the creation of graphs created from Fast Fourier Transforms of the data.

.. note:

   This is a relatively new feature in ArduPilot.  No stable firmware has been released containing this feature

Enabling Batch Data Collection
==============================

The ``INS_LOG_BAT_MASK`` parameter specifies which IMUs in the system to log high-rate data for.  Set this to 255 to collect for all sensors.

``IMU RAW`` sampling must be enabled in your logging bitmask.  This is bit 19, so you must either use a GCS which has checkboxes for each bitmask option or add 524288 to your current bitmask value.

``INS_LOG_BAT_OPT`` must be set to one

.. note:

   ``IMU_FAST`` must be turned off in your LOG_BITMASK for batch sampling to work


Collecting useful Data
======================

It can take some time to transfer the FFT data to the SD card.  The data is "dribbled" out to the card to avoid unnecessary system load.  This may not combine wellwith short flights and ``LOG_DISARMED`` not being set; the log may be closed before the data reaches the card.  Fly for longer, or set ``LOG_DISARMED`` to ``1``.

Sensor Rate Logging
-------------------

Some sensors in ArduPilot have the option of logging data at the same rate it is received from the sensor.  For example, InvenSense sensors may give you 8kHz gyro samples and 4kHz accelerometer samples.  This data will help you find vibrations at frequencies above what normal (1kHz) batch sampling will allow.

The following two graphs are from the same flight on a PixRacer flight controller.  It has one InvenseSense IMU:

    :target:  ../../../images/imu-batchsampling-fft-sensorrate-pixracer.png


Finding the Log Messages
========================

There are two types of dataflash log messages involved in batch sampling, `ISBH` and `ISBD`.

`ISBH` is a batch header; it includes a batch number and metadata about the batch.

`ISBD` messages contain the actual data for the batch, and reference a header by batch number.

Extracting Information from the log messages
============================================

Fast Fourier Analysis
---------------------

Fast Fourier Analysis transforms data from the time domain into the frequency domain.  A frequent feature of such a graph is a rotor's "blade passage frequency", the frequency at which the blade crosses the aircraft, causing an acceleration in the aircraft body.

Limitations
...........

A FFT can not show you frequencies above half your sensor's sampling rate.

The smallest frequency that can be shown is half your sample size divided by your sample rate.

Several tools can create graphs of the data after it has been FFT'd.

Tuning Data Collection
======================

``INS_LOG_BAT_CNT`` specifies the number of samples which will be collected.  Increasing this will yield a more representative idea of problem frequencies.  When divided by the sample rate will give the smallest frequency which can be detected, so 1024 samples at 1024kHz sampling will (poorly) pick up 0.5Hz frequencies.

``INS_LOG_BAT_MSK`` can be used to sample just a single sensor.  This will increase the number of samples retrieved from a single sensor (e.g. the best on the platform), which may provide better data for analysis.

``INS_LOG_BAT_OPT`` an options bitmask which can be used to change the behaviour of the Batch Sampler, for example to specify sensor-rate-logging

``INS_LOG_BAT_LGIN`` interval between pushing samples to the dataflash log, in ms.  Increase this to reduce the time taken to flush data to the dataflash log, reducing cycle time.  This will be at the expense of increased system load and possibly choking up the dataflash log for other messages.

``INS_LOG_BAT_LGCT`` Number of samples to push to count every ``INS_LOG_BAT_LGIN`` ms.  Increase this to push more samples each time they are sent to the dataflash log.  Increasing this may cause timing jitter, and possibly choke up the dataflash log for other messages.
