- Make the changes in the "Edit file" tab and use the "Preview changes" tab to check the change.  Note: links to other wiki pages are not rendered properly and will appear with ``:ref:``` in front
- At the bottom of the page under "Commit changes"

   - Fill in the subject line with a short description of the change
   - Optionally fill in an extended description 
   - Click "Create a new branch for this commit"
   - Press the "Commit changes" button

- When taken to the "Open a pull request" screen, press the "Create pull request" button

For more information see the Github Help topic: `Editing files in another user's repository <https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-another-user-s-repository/>`__

.. note::

    Wiki home pages (named "index.html") do not have the **Edit on GitHub** link. You can still edit them by manually navigating to the desired page on Github.
