UART Mapping
============

The UARTs are marked Rn and Tn in the above pinouts. The Rn pin is the
receive pin for UARTn. The Tn pin is the transmit pin for UARTn.


- SERIAL0 -> USB
- SERIAL1 -> UART1 (default RC protocol, DMA-enabled)
- SERIAL2 -> UART2 (DMA-enabled)
- SERIAL3 -> UART3 (default ESC Telem protocol)
- SERIAL4 -> UART4 (default GPS protocol, DMA-enabled)
- SERIAL5 -> UART5 (User)
- SERIAL6 -> UART6 (default protocol DJI Goggles, DMA-enabled)
- SERIAL7 -> UART7 (DMA-enabled)
- SERIAL8 -> UART8


Any UART may be re-tasked by changing its protocol parameter.

RC Input
========

RC input is configured on the R1 (UART1_RX) pin. It supports all RC protocols except PPM. See :ref:`common-rc-systems` for details for a specific RC system. :ref:`SERIAL6_PROTOCOL<SERIAL6_PROTOCOL>` is set to "23", by default, to enable this.

- SBUS/DSM/SRXL connects to the R1 pin.

- FPort requires connection to T1 and :ref:`SERIAL6_OPTIONS<SERIAL6_OPTIONS>` be set to "7".

- CRSF also requires a T1 connection, in addition to R6, and automatically provides telemetry. Set :ref:`SERIAL6_OPTIONS<SERIAL6_OPTIONS>` to "0".

- SRXL2 requires a connecton to T1 and automatically provides telemetry.  Set :ref:`SERIAL6_OPTIONS<SERIAL6_OPTIONS>` to "4".

Any UART can be used for RC system connections in ArduPilot also, and is compatible with all protocols except PPM. See :ref:`common-rc-systems` for details.

OSD Support
===========

The autopilot has an integrated OSD using :ref:`OSD_TYPE<OSD_TYPE>` 1 (MAX7456 driver). The defaults are also setup to allow DJI Goggle OSD support on UART6.

PWM Output
==========

The autopilot supports up to 8 PWM outputs. Outputs 1-4 are available via a JST-SH connector. All 8 outputs support DShot and bi-directional DShot, as well as all PWM types.

The PWM is in 3 groups:

 - PWM 1, 2 in group1
 - PWM 3, 4 in group2
 - PWM 5, 6 in group3
 - PWM 7, 8 in group4
 - PWM 9 (LED) in group5

Channels within the same group need to use the same output rate, whether PWM or Dshot. If
any channel in a group uses DShot then all channels in the group need
to use DShot.

LED Output
==========

The LED output is configured by default to support :ref:`NeoPixel LED strings<common-serial-led-neopixel>`.

VTX Voltage Selection/Control
=============================

A solder jumper pad (VTX+)is provided to allow selection of 5V or 10V output to the "10V" pads. Another solder pad (Jp) selects if the supply is always on or switchable for Pit mode operation.

If configured for switchable operation, set :ref:`RELAY_PIN<RELAY_PIN>` = 81 to control on or off with RELAY1 in ArduPilot

Camera Selection
================

Two camera inputs are provided. C1 is selected by default. In order to switch to camera 2 (C2), set :ref:`RELAY_PIN2<RELAY_PIN2>` = 82 to allow RELAY2 to control selection of cameras.

GPIO Output
===========

An additional GPIO output is provided via the OSD pin. It can be controlled by setting :ref:`RELAY_PIN3<RELAY_PIN3>` = 82 and using RELAY3 to change its level.

Battery Monitoring
==================

The board has a built-in voltage sensor via the B+ pin, but no internal current sensor. An external current sensor can be connected to the CUR pin. Default parameters for both internal voltage and external current monitoring are set by default to the below for use with any Holybro Tekko32 F4 4in1 ESC.

The correct battery setting parameters are:

 - :ref:`BATT_MONITOR<BATT_MONITOR>` 4
 - :ref:`BATT_VOLT_PIN<BATT_VOLT_PIN>` 10
 - :ref:`BATT_CURR_PIN<BATT_CURR_PIN>` 11
 - :ref:`BATT_VOLT_MULT<BATT_VOLT_MULT>` 11.1
 - :ref:`BATT_AMP_PERVLT<BATT_AMP_PERVLT>` varies depending on external current sensor

Compass
=======

The autopilot does not have a built-in compass, however you can attach an external compass using I2C on the SDA and SCL pads.

Firmware
========

Firmware for this board can be found `here <https://firmware.ardupilot.org>`_ in  sub-folders labeled "SkystarsH7HD-bdshot".

Loading Firmware
================

Initial firmware load can be done with DFU by plugging in USB with the
bootloader button pressed. Then you should load the "with_bl.hex"
firmware, using your favourite DFU loading tool.

Once the initial firmware is loaded you can update the firmware using
any ArduPilot ground station software. Later updates should be done with the
\*.apj firmware files.
