First Person View (FPV)
=======================

*First Person View* provides you with a true pilot's eye view while
flying by placing a video camera and transmitter on your vehicle paired
with a receiver and either an LCD or goggles on the ground.  An optional
OSD (On Screen Display) helps maintain orientation by providing aircraft
instrument overlay on your FPV monitor.

Recommended parts
=================

To set up an FPV system on your Copter/Plane equipped vehicle you will
need:

-  `Sony CCD camera <http://www.amazon.com/Miniature-Color-Camera-Super-520TV/dp/B00LAK573Y>`__
-  `MinimOSD <http://store.jdrones.com/jD_MiniOSD_V12_p/jdminiosd12.htm>`__
   for On Screen Display of aircraft data
-  5.8Ghz 200mw video transmitter/receiver pair
-  Two 900mAh LiPo batteries (one for the air, one for the ground) to
   power the transmitter, receiver and camera

In addition you will need a monitor like the `Black Pearl <http://www.amazon.com/FlySight-Black-Pearl-Diversity-Integrated/dp/B00KR69WHY>`__
or goggles.

**Goggle options:**

-  `Fat Shark <http://www.fatshark.com/default.html>`__ has a wide range
   of goggles including the "Attitude" and "Dominator" that have been
   proven to work.  Note that some models come with a built in
   transmitter & receiver that would replace the 3DR video kits 5.8 Ghz
   transmitter/receiver pair mentioned above.
-  Low cost 320x240 resolution goggles (`example video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG-4JNpE2fc>`__) are not
   recommended because the higher resolution 640x480 (`example video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywqacXyjcNw>`__) or SVGA
   goggles provide a much better flying experience.

In addition you may wish to set-up a separate :ref:`camera gimbal <common-cameras-and-gimbals>`\ (perhaps with Go-Pro
attached) to record the flight in HD.

Connection diagram
==================

Here is a wiring diagram `created by IVC <http://beta.ivc.no/wiki/index.php/TBS_Discovery_graphic>`__ for a
TBS Discovery Quadcopter that includes an APM2 and MinimOSD:

    :target: ../_images/tbs_discovery_install_APM2.6withminimosdtbscore.jpg

FPV equipment on the vehicle should be placed as far away as possible
from GPS and RC receiver to reduce the chance of interference.

Minim OSD setup through mission planner

Note the TBS frame spreads the 2 front arms apart so the blades don't
interfere with the FPV and allow the camera to easily be mounted in
front

Safety Warnings Relating Specifically to FPV Flight
===================================================

-  Because of the limited field-of-view of the FPV camera you may not be
   able to easily see obstacles near the vehicle which may be why the
   `Academy of Model Aeronautics <https://www.modelaircraft.org/>`__
   requires that there be a second person acting as spotter for all FPV
   flights.
-  Be ready for loss of FPV video caused by flying beyond your FPV
   systems limits or interference from structures between you and the
   vehicle.
-  Know and recognise the FPV signal loss warning signs and be ready to
   shed the FPV equipment and retake line-of-sight control at all times.
-  FPV equipment can interfere with the vehicle's radio or GPS if placed
   too close
