Rover is an advanced :ref:`open source <dev:license-gplv3>` autopilot for
guiding **ground vehicles** and **boats**. It can run fully autonomous
missions that are defined using mission planning software or
pre-recorded by the driver during a manual run.

Rover runs on the :ref:`Pixhawk <common-pixhawk-overview>` and a number of other :ref:`supported autopilot boards <common-autopilots>`.

This is the platform that won the `2013 and 2014 Sparkfun Autonomous Vehicle Competition <https://avc.sparkfun.com/>`__! That said, Rover is
far more than just a toy - it is already being used in numerous
applications (you can see a few examples including agricultural
automation in our :ref:`Video Demos <rover-video-demonstrations>`).
