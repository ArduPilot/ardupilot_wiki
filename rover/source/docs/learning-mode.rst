Learning Mode (deprecated)
==========================

In Rover-3.2 (and higher) Learning mode has been removed and replaced by the "Save Waypoint" :ref:`auxiliary switch function <common-auxiliary-functions>`.

In Rover-3.1 and earlier, Learning drove exactly like :ref:`Manual <manual-mode>` and waypoints would be saved in the mission command list when the channel 7 switch was momentarily toggled.

There is more information on this mode in the topic :ref:`Learning a Mission <learning-a-mission>`.
