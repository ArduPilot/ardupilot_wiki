Manual mode
===========

In Manual mode the transmitter's steering and throttle sticks directly control the vehicle's throttle and steering output.

- this mode does not require a position estimate (i.e. GPS is not required)
- it is recommended to always have one :ref:`transmitter mode switch <common-rc-transmitter-flight-mode-configuration>` position assigned to this mode
- the throttle slew still applies. See the bottom of the :ref:`Tuning Speed and Throttle <rover-tuning-throttle-and-speed>` page for more details of the throttle slew limit
