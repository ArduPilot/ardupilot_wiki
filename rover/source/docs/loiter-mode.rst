Loiter mode allows boats to hold position in a strong current.

.. note::

   This mode is available in Rover-3.4 (and higher).

   If the mode does not appear in the :ref:`Flight mode setup screen <common-rc-transmitter-flight-mode-configuration>` you can manually set a MODEx parameter to '5'.

The way this mode works is:

- the user switches into Loiter mode and the vehicleâ€™s current position, velocity and maximum deceleration are used to project a reasonable stopping point
- while the boat is within the :ref:`LOIT_RADIUS<LOIT_RADIUS>` of the target it simply drifts
- if/when the boat strays more than :ref:`LOIT_RADIUS<LOIT_RADIUS>` from the target it:

    - rotates to point either directly towards the target or directly away from it (whichever results in less rotation)
    - drives/floats forwards or backwards at 0.5 m/s * the distance to the edge of the circle around the target, but at a speed no greater than :ref:`WP_SPEED<WP_SPEED>`.

.. tip:: In order to obtain the optimum performance, the ESC deadband should be small. The :ref:`MOT_THR_MIN<MOT_THR_MIN>` can be used to compensate for ESC deadband. See this :ref:`section<rover-motor-and-servo-min-throttle>` for details.
