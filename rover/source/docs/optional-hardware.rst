Telemetry Radio
===============

A :ref:`telemetry radio <common-telemetry-landingpage>` allows your Rover
to communicate with your ground station remotely using the MAVLink
protocol. This allows you to interact with your missions in real time
and receive streaming data from your vehicle's cameras and other
components. This adds considerable convenience to your missions!
