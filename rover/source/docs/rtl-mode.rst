RTL Mode
=========

RTL stands for Return-To-Launch.  When switched into RTL mode the vehicle will turn and attempt to directly return to the position where it was last armed.

-  The RTL_SPEED parameter can be used to set the speed (in meters/second) at which the vehicle will return to home.  By default this parameter is zero meaning it will use the WP_SPEED or CRUISE_SPEED.
