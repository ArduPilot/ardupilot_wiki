RTL Mode
========

RTL stands for Return-To-Launch.  When switched into RTL mode the vehicle will turn and attempt to directly return to the position where it was last armed.

-  The :ref:`RTL_SPEED <RTL_SPEED>` parameter can be used to set the speed (in meters/second) at which the vehicle will return to home.  By default this parameter is zero meaning it will use the :ref:`WP_SPEED <WP_SPEED>` or :ref:`CRUISE_SPEED <CRUISE_SPEED>`.
