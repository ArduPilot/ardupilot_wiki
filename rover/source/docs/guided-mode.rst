.. _guided-mode:

===========
GUIDED mode
===========

-  Does not require a dedicated switch, so don't select it as a flight
   mode.
-  Allows you to use a :ref:`telemetry radio <common-telemetry-landingpage>` to specify waypoints on a
   map in mission planner.
-  And "tell" the Rover to go to those waypoints.
-  Allow you to use advance control behavior such as position or velocity controls.
-  See the :ref:`APMCopter Guided Mode Description <copter:ac2_guidedmode>`
   for a overview of how it works.
