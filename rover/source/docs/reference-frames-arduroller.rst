ArduRoller is a BalanceBot frame originally designed by Jason Short (described in `this Makezine article <https://makezine.com/projects/arduroller-self-balancing-robot/>`__).  Rover-3.5 (and higher) supports this frame as described below.

One issue with this frame is that there is some play in the motors which leads to a slightly wobble when standing still.  This could be resolved by using `stepper motors <https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot/issues/9172>`__
