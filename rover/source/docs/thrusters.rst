The `BlueRobotics T100, T200 and T500 thrusters <https://www.bluerobotics.com/product-category/thrusters/>`__ are commonly used thrusters that can be controlled using :ref:`regular reversible brushless motor ESCs <common-brushless-escs>`

Clockwise and Counter-Clockwise propellers are included and should be used for skid-steering and omni vehicles to better balance the torque which could affect the vehicle's heading control

If using :ref:`BLHeli ESCs <common-blheli32-passthru>` use the configuration app to set:

- "Motor Direction" to "Bidirectional 3D" 
- "Low RPM Power Protect" to "Off"
