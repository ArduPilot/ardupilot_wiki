The `BlueRobotics T100 and T200 thrusters <https://www.bluerobotics.com/product-category/thrusters/>`__ are commonly used thrusters that can be controlled using a regular reversible brushless motor ESCs  :ref:`common-brushless-escs`

Clockwise and Counter-Clockwise propellers are included and should be used for skid-steering and omni vehicles to better balance the torque which could affect the vehicle's heading control

If using reversible BLHeli DShot ESCs, use :ref:`common-blheli32-passthru` to set:

- "Motor Direction" to "Bidirectional 3D" 
- "Low RPM Power Protect" to "Off"
