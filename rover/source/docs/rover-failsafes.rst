Failsafes
=========

Rover supports three failsafe mechanisms as described below.

Radio Failsafe (aka Throttle Failsafe)
--------------------------------------

.. image:: ../images/rover-failsafe-rc.jpg
    :target: ../_images/rover-failsafe-rc.jpg

This failsafe is triggered if the connection between the user's transmitter and the receiver on the vehicle is lost for at least :ref:`FS_TIMEOUT <FS_TIMEOUT>` seconds.

- the loss of transmitter/receiver connection is detected by:

  - no signals being sent from the receiver to the autopilot board OR
  - the throttle channel (normally input channel 3) value falling below the :ref:`FS_THR_VALUE <FS_THR_VALUE>` parameter value

- set :ref:`FS_THR_ENABLE <FS_THR_ENABLE>` to "1" to enable this failsafe
- if :ref:`FS_ACTION <FS_ACTION>` is "1", the vehicle will :ref:`RTL <rtl-mode>` to home, if "2" the vehicle will :ref:`Hold <hold-mode>`, if "3" or "4" the vehicle will attempt to use :ref:`SmartRTL <smartrtl-mode>` but if this mode cannot be engaged the vehicle will :ref:`RTL <rtl-mode>` or :ref:`Hold <hold-mode>` respectively.
- once the transmitter/receiver connection is restored, the user must use the transmitter's mode switch to re-take control of the vehicle in :ref:`Manual <manual-mode>` (or any other mode)

Battery Failsafe
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

    This failsafe requires the vehicle have a working :ref:`Power Module <common-powermodule-landingpage>`.

.. note:: ArduPilot firmware versions 4.0 and later support up to 10 batteries/power monitors. All the  discussion below applies to those optional batteries also. Each can trigger a failsafe and each can have different actions and setup values. In addition, a group of batteries can be treated as a single unit, see ``BATTx_MONITOR`` = 10.

When the failsafe will trigger
------------------------------

If enabled and set-up correctly the battery failsafe will trigger if the main battery's

-  voltage drops below the voltage held in the :ref:`BATT_LOW_VOLT <BATT_LOW_VOLT>` parameter (or FS_BATT_VOLTAGE in older versions) for more than 10 seconds. If set to zero (the default value) the voltage based trigger will be disabled.
-  remaining capacity falls below the :ref:`BATT_LOW_MAH <BATT_LOW_MAH>` parameter (or FS_BATT_MAH in older versions) 20% of the battery's full capacity is a good choice (i.e. "1000" for a 5000mAh battery).  If set to zero (the default) the capacity based trigger will be disabled (i.e. only voltage will be used)

What will happen
----------------

When the failsafe is triggered:

-  Buzzer will play a loud low-battery alarm
-  LEDs will flash yellow
-  A warning message will be displayed on the ground station's HUD (if telemetry is connected)
-  :ref:`BATT_FS_LOW_ACT <BATT_FS_LOW_ACT>` configures the failsafe action to take.  "0" to take no action (default), "1" to change into :ref:`RTL <rtl-mode>`, "2" to change to :ref:`Hold <hold-mode>`, if "3" or "4" the vehicle will attempt to use :ref:`SmartRTL <smartrtl-mode>` but if this mode cannot be engaged the vehicle will :ref:`RTL <rtl-mode>` or :ref:`Hold <hold-mode>` respectively.  "5" will disarm the vehicle.

Two-Stage Battery Failsafe
--------------------------

Rover also includes a two-layer battery failsafe.  This allows setting up a follow-up action if the battery voltage or remaining capacity falls below an even lower threshold.

- :ref:`BATT_CRT_VOLT <BATT_CRT_VOLT>` - holds the secondary (lower) voltage threshold.  Set to zero to disable. Default is zero.
- :ref:`BATT_CRT_MAH <BATT_CRT_MAH>` - holds the secondary (lower) capacity threshold.  Set to zero to disable. Default is zero.
- :ref:`BATT_FS_CRT_ACT <BATT_FS_CRT_ACT>` - holds the secondary action to take. It has the same options and default as :ref:`BATT_FS_LOW_ACT <BATT_FS_LOW_ACT>`.

Advanced Battery Failsafe Settings
----------------------------------

- :ref:`BATT_FS_VOLTSRC <BATT_FS_VOLTSRC>` allows configuring whether the raw battery voltage or a sag corrected voltage is used
- :ref:`BATT_LOW_TIMER <BATT_LOW_TIMER>` can configure how long the voltage must be below the threshold for the failsafe to trigger (10 sec default)
- ``BATTx_`` parameters can be setup to trigger the failsafe on other batteries

GCS Failsafe (aka Telemetry Failsafe)
-------------------------------------

This failsafe is triggered if the vehicle stops receiving `heartbeat messages <https://mavlink.io/en/messages/common.html#HEARTBEAT>`__ from the ground station for at least :ref:`FS_TIMEOUT <FS_TIMEOUT>` seconds.

- set :ref:`FS_GCS_ENABLE <FS_GCS_ENABLE>` to "1" to enable this failsafe
- if :ref:`FS_ACTION <FS_ACTION>` is "1", the vehicle will :ref:`RTL <rtl-mode>` to home, if "2" the vehicle will :ref:`Hold <hold-mode>`
- you must use the transmitter's mode switch to re-take control of the vehicle in :ref:`Manual <manual-mode>` (or any other mode), or change modes via the GCS iself, if communication is re-established.

Crash Check
-----------

If enabled by setting the :ref:`FS_CRASH_CHECK <FS_CRASH_CHECK>` parameter to "1" (for :ref:`Hold <hold-mode>`) or "2" (for :ref:`Hold <hold-mode>` and Disarm) this failsafe will switch the vehicle to Hold and then (optionally) disarm the vehicle if all the following are true for at least 2 seconds:

- the vehicle is in :ref:`Auto <auto-mode>`, :ref:`Guided <guided-mode>`, :ref:`RTL <rtl-mode>` or :ref:`SmartRTL <smartrtl-mode>` mode
- velocity falls below 0.08m/s (i.e. 8cm/s)
- the vehicle is turning at less than 4.5 deg/s
- demanded throttle to the motors (from the pilot or autopilot) is at least 5%

Hold Mode Failsafes
-------------------

The :ref:`FS_OPTIONS<FS_OPTIONS>` bitmask parameter determines if failsafes will be recognized while in HOLD Mode. If bit 0 is set, then failsafes will be recognized and acted upon. If not, failsafes will be ignored in HOLD mode (default).

Independent Watchdog
--------------------

See :ref:`common-watchdog` for details.
