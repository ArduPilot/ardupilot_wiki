Acro Mode
=========

In Acro mode the user's steering stick controls the vehicle's turn rate while the throttle stick controls the vehicle's speed.

-  The :ref:`ACRO_TURN_RATE <ACRO_TURN_RATE>` parameter controls the maximum turn rate the user's steering stick can request.  This mode is perhaps most useful for tuning the vehicle's turn rate controller.
