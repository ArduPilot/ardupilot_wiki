Sailing Vehicles Home
======================

ArduRover now supports sailing vehicles. Only sail boats have been tested so far, although there is no reason land based vehicles wouldnâ€™t work. It is recommended that the user familiarizes themselves with the basic principles and terminology of sailing and sailboats.

Try it in the simulator:
------------------------
ArduRover has a basic sailboat simulator, this can be launched directly from Mission Planner. It is a great way to try out the functionality before building your own vehicle, especially if your new to ArduPilot.

Before you proceed:
-------------------
Sailboat support is new to ROVER as of November 2018, and is available in Stable releases at this time. Please bear in mind that the code may still have some issues. The more people try out and test sailing support the faster the bugs can be found and fixed.
