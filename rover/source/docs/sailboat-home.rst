ArduRover now supports sailing vehicles. Only sail boats have been tested so far, although there is no reason land based vehicles wouldnâ€™t work. It is recommended that the user familiarises themselves with the basic principles and terminology of sailing and sailboats.

-------------------
Sailboat support is new to ROVER as of November 2018, and is only avalable in master at this time. Please bear in mind that the new code may still have some issues. The more people try out and test sailing support the faster the bugs can be found and fixed.
