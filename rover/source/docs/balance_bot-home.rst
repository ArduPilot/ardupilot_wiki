Currently, Balance Bots work only in Manual and Hold modes.

Before you proceed:
-------------------
Balance bot support will be officially included in Rover-3.5 (and higher).  Until this is released, it can be tested using "latest" which can be downloaded from the Mission Planner's Install Firmware screen by pressing Ctrl-Q.  Please note though that "latest" has not gone through beta testing and may have issues.
