System components
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


-  A Pixhawk or :ref:`other autopilot <common-autopilots>` 
   loaded with the latest version of
   the `Copter firmware <https://firmware.ardupilot.org/>`__.
-  :ref:`Mission Planner software <planner:home>` -- gives
   you an easy point-and-click setup/configuration, and a full-featured
   ground control interface.
-  This Copter Wiki provides all the information you need to set up and
   operate a multicopter or traditional helicopter. 
-  A suitable
   :ref:`MultiCopter <build-your-own-multicopter>` or
   :ref:`Helicopter <traditional-helicopters>` for your mission.
-  Plus many other useful options: e.g. data radios, which allow two-way
   wireless telemetry and control between the vehicle and your computer.

:ref:`Multicopters <what-is-a-multicopter-and-how-does-it-work>`:

-  Utilize differential thrust management of independent motor-prop
   units to provide lift and directional control
-  Benefit from mechanical simplicity and design flexibility
-  A capable payload lifter that's functional in strong wind conditions
-  Redundant lift sources can give increased margin of safety
-  Varied form factor allows convenient options for payload mounting.


:ref:`Helicopters <traditional-helicopters>`:

-  Typically use a single lifting rotor with two or more blades
-  Maintain directional control by varying blade pitch via
   servo-actuated mechanical linkage (many versions of these craft exist
   and it is beyond the scope of this manual to cover them all -- the
   mechanical systems used in helicopters warrant special study and
   consideration)
-  Strong, fast and efficient -- a proven-worker suitable to many missions.



Because of its open design, Copter also supports more unusual frame
types including the :ref:`Single and Coax-Copters <singlecopter-and-coaxcopter>`.  Put this together
with `Plane <https://ardupilot.org/plane/index.html>`__,
:ref:`Rover <rover:home>` and :ref:`Antenna Tracker <antennatracker:home>` and you have a system
of robotic vehicles that can be controlled through very similar
interfaces to accomplish a wide variety of tasks.

.. |TOP_COL_LEFT| replace:: This is the full-featured, :ref:`open-source <dev:license-gplv3>` 
   multicopter UAV controller that won the   
   `Sparkfun 2013 and 2014 Autonomous Vehicle Competition <https://avc.sparkfun.com/>`__ 
   (dominating with the top five spots). A team of developers 
   from around the globe are constantly improving and refining 
   the performance and capabilities of ArduCopter.
   
.. |TOP_COL_RIGHT| replace:: Copter is capable of the full range of flight requirements 
   from fast paced FPV racing to smooth aerial photography, and fully autonomous 
   complex missions which can be programmed through a number of compatible 
   software ground stations. The entire package is designed to be safe, feature rich, 
   open-ended for custom applications, and is increasingly easy to use even for the novice.
