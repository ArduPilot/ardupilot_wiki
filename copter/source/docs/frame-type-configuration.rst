Frame Type Configuration in Mission Planner
===========================================

On the *Mission Planner*'s Initial Setup screen select **Mandatory
Hardware \| Frame Type**. Select the frame for your copter. The default
configuration is **X**. If you want one of the arms to serve as the
exclusive front-facing direction, select the **Plus** configuration. For
Tricopters, Traditional Helis and Y6s, the frame type is ignored.

   Mission Planner:Select Frame Type

.. note::

   For an H-Frame quadcopter use the option to set the frame type to
   '3' in the *Advanced Parameter* Tab. To apply the H-frame configuration,
   swap the left rear and right rear props and reverse the motor direction
   for each of those motors (by swapping any two motor wires). Repeat the
   same process for the front two motors.
