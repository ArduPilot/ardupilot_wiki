Traditional Helicopter â€” RC Calibration
=======================================

This page covers specific details about calibrating the RC controller for a helicopter.

.. warning::

   Before powering the autopilot and servo rail for the first time, 
   disconnect the rudder linkage from the tail servo or bellcrank on the tail 
   gearbox. If you have a piston engine helicopter, also disconnect the throttle
   servo linkage. 

The RC MUST be calibrated before proceeding once the autopilot is powered up. RC calibration is identical to all other vehicles. With helicopters using the ArduPilot system there can be no mixes in the RC radio. All the outputs must be
"pure", i.e. use either airplane mode in your radio, or helicopter mode with H1 or "straight" swash.
