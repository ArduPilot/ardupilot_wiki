   `here <https://diydrones.com/forum/topics/arducopter-2-2-beta>`__
   .

-  Dec 16, 2011: Copter 2.1 released. This is the first version that
   supports both the APM 1 and APM 2 boards. If you're building it with
   Arduino, you'll need the "relaxpatch" version of Arduino. To
   harmonize with APM 2, the hardware CLI switch is no longer used--you
   now get into the CLI by hitting "Enter" three times in a terminal.
   Other details are in the announcement post
   `here <https://diydrones.com/forum/topics/arducopter-2-0-56>`__ .

-  Dec 3, 2011: Copter 2.0.55 released. Most stable flying version yet.
   Includes new stability patch by default and a new DCM gain and clamp
   value that should reduce drift due to linear acceleration in missions
   or long flights. Switched rate gain calculation to use raw IMU rather
   than the DCM's omega. This crisps up the response a lot. 1280 has
   lost local flash logging, sorry, but it's just not supportable any
   longer. Some older tests have returned now the program memory is
   freed. Remember, to use the new logging format on the 2560, you need
   to erase it at least once to format it.

-  Nov 30, 2011: Copter 2.0.54 released. Bug fixes, better alt hold, CH7
   switch to Simple Mode enabled.

-  Nov 19, 2011: Copter 2.0.50 released. Many bug fixes and performance
   enhancements. Log files will now overwrite from the beginning when
   the dataflash is full (rather than stopping). Initial compatibility
   with MAVLink 1.0. A full list of changes is
   `here <https://www.diydrones.com/forum/topics/arducopter-2-0-50>`__ .

-  Oct 16, 2011: Copter 2.0.49 released. Tweaked Alt Hold PIDs, Loiter
   PIDs based on SIM testing and feedback. Increased distance error for
   loiter for faster return to center. Params for camera roll gain
   fixed.

-  Oct 14, 2011: Copter 2.0.48 released. The PWM output has been set to
   400hz (to counter the low pass filter in most Turnigy PWMs). The
   DCM's Roll and Pitch gains were lowered to .03 (recommendation of
   Hein Hollander). MAVLink has gotten a re-work for performance and
   memory savings.

-  Oct 7, 2011: Copter 2.0.47 released. Fixed RTL overshooting bug.
   Better loiter PIDs

-  Oct 2, 2011: Copter 2.0.46 released. Rolls up all changes since
   2.0.42, including improved sensor filtering, loiter and waypoint
   navigation. Simple mode has been changed and Guided mode added `(see
   this post for more
   information). <https://diydrones.com/forum/topics/arducopter-2-0-43>`__

-  Sept 11, 2011: Copter 2.0.42 released. Includes much more efficient
   DCM processing, now running 25% faster. Should be most stable yet.
   Also includes improved Circle mode.

-  Sept 7, 2011: Copter 2.0.40 released. Totally new control laws, which
   are much more effective. Loiter should now stay within a 1m box and
   RTL is rock solid. New Alt Hold mixes the temperature sensor reading
   with the barometric pressure sensor readings for drift-free results.
   New flight modes, including user configurable ones. This is a release
   candidate for the first non-beta code.

-  August 23, 2011: Copter 2.0.39b released. Many bug fixes and some
   experimental new control laws. This release is mostly for beta
   testing feedback to prepare for 2.0.40, which is a non-beta release
   candidate.

-  July 30, 2011: Copter Beta 2.0.38 released. Lots of changes, big and
   small. Moved ground start to first arming. Added ground start flag.
   Moved throttle_integrator to 50hz loop. CAMERA_STABILIZER
   deprecated - now always on. Renamed current logging bit mask to match
   APM. Added MA filter to PID - D term. Adjusted PIDs based on
   continued testing and new PID filter. Added MASK_LOG_SET_DEFAULTS
   to match APM. Moved some stuff out of ground start into system start
   where it belonged. Added slower Yaw gains for DCM when the copter is
   in the air. Changed camera output to be none scaled PWM. Fixed bug
   where ground_temperature was unfiltered. Shortened Baro startup
   time. Fixed issue with Nav_WP integrator not being reset. RTL no
   longer yaws towards home. Circle mode for flying a 10m circle around
   the point where it was engaged (not tested at all! Consider it
   experimental).

-  July 17, 2011: Copter Beta 2.0.37 released. Added rate of change
   limit for noisy Sonars. Code converted to static functions to save
   memory.

-  July 16, 2011: AC Beta 2.0.36 released. Added Yaw control when
   descending in Alt hold, lowered kP & kD for Alt hold a tad, Adjusted
   RTL behavior to do speed control up to 4m to home, then go into
   Loiter. Fixed issue with AUTO not getting proper input.

-  July 12, 2011: AC Beta 2.0.35 released. Added camera reversing
   parameters in AP_Var, Added RTL Throttle Hold set/check, Added
   dynamic speed control to slow down as you reach waypoints and RTL
   Home, upped Yaw Dead zone slightly. Available as a hex firmware
   download in the Mission Planner.

-  July 9, 2011: AC Beta 2.0.34 preview released. Lots of new control
   laws and needs more testing before we give this wide release. Right
   now it's download only (get the file from the download section above
   and compile and load with Arduino). Full description of the changes
   in this release is
   `here. <https://diydrones.com/forum/topics/arducopter-2034-preview>`__

-  July 2, 2011: AC Beta 2.0.32 released: New Loiter PIDs, tuned down
   control on standard frame, shunk the mixing range for sonar from 3
   meters to 2 meters, added framework for Guided mode - not tested!
   removed pitch and roll deadzone, decoupled S, MPLE mode from LOITER
   PIDs Synced MAVLink with APM, Logs report correct WP number now.
   Disabled Sonar spike filter.

-  June 29, 2011: AC Beta 2.0.30 released. Minor bug fixes. Note that
   there is a known issue with the magnetometer, due to a change in the
   sensor used in recent DIY Drones magnetometer boards. The code to
   autodetect which one you have is still a big wonky and compass
   readings my be off by a factor of 2. We'll fix that in the next
   update.

-  June 27, 2011: AC Beta 2.0.28 released. Fixed serious bug (exit from
   !Alt_Hold left quad with controls reversed) in 2.0.26, and other
   tweaks. All users should upgrade immediately.

-  June 24, 2011: AC2 Beta 2.0.26 released: Minor updates. Arming motors
   now for only Stabilize, Simple, and Acro Modes. V Octo Support.

-  June 19, 2011: AC2 Beta 2.0.25 released. This brings Copter
   (traditional heli) into the AC2 trunk, giving it full MAVLink
   capability, too. Many other tweaks and performance improvements
   (details
   `here <https://diydrones.com/forum/topics/arducopter-2024b>`__ ).
   Getting close now!

-  June 5, 2011: Much improved Mission Planner 1.0 released. Check out
   the `gorgeous new design! <https://www.diydrones.com/profiles/blogs/new-apm-planner-10>`__

-  June 3, 2011: `AC2 Beta 2.0.23 released. <https://diydrones.com/forum/topics/arducopter-2023>`__
   Minor bug fixes and tuning to improve loiter and hex airframe
   performance. Sonar test added to CLI test suite.

-  May 27, 2011: AC2 Beta 2.0.16
   `released <https://diydrones.com/forum/topics/705844:Topic:393643>`__
   . Improvements in yaw control, minor changes in LED function, and
   other bug fixes. The Mission Planner has also been updated, so check
   the Update menu item in that to upgrade. Just a few more things left
   to get beta test feedback on before we'll feel confident in taking
   AC2 out of beta.

-  May 18, 2011: `AC2 beta 2.0.6 <https://www.diydrones.com/profiles/blogs/ac2-206-beta>`__
   released. We're still bug-fixing at a rapid pace, so thanks for your
   patience. The Mission Planner has been significantly revamped,
   especially on the firmware upload process, which is now based on
   visual icons. Frame choices are now made at firmware upload time, but
   orientation (x vs +) can be made in the CLI. We still recommend that
   new users stick with the `ArduPirates code <https://code.google.com/archive/p/ardupirates/wikis/Softwares_Building.wiki>`__
   , but people with well-tested hardware are invited to join the AC2
   beta test. Feedback at DIY Drones, please.

-  May 14, 2011: AC2 beta is improving quickly, thanks to the huge
   increase in feedback and testing from the open beta release. The
   latest tested version can always be downloaded from the Mission
   Planner. At this point, we feel that it is stable enough for most
   users with well-tested hardware, although please remember it's still
   in beta so there may still be some bugs and you're flying at your own
   risk. Go through the setup process carefully and please read the
   manual before flying!

-  May 7, 2011: Copter 2 first beta released. Details
   `here <https://www.diydrones.com/profiles/blogs/arducopter-20-beta-first>`__
   . This is an early public beta and may be unstable. Some features and
   portions of the manual are a work in progress and will be changed
   over the next few weeks. Most users are advised to continue using
   `ArduPirates code <https://code.google.com/archive/p/ardupirates/wikis/Softwares_Building.wiki>`__
   until Copter 2 comes out of beta.

-  May 5, 2011: Manual revised for Copter 2. Older Copter 1 manual
   unavailable (was on old google.code site).
