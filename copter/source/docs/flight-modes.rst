Flight Modes
============

This article provides an overview and links to the available flight modes
for Copter.

Overview
========

Copter has 25 flight built-in flight modes, 10 of which are regularly
used. There are modes to support different levels/types of flight
stabilization, a sophisticated autopilot, a follow-me system etc.

Flight modes are controlled through the radio (via a :ref:`transmitter switch <common-rc-transmitter-flight-mode-configuration>`),
via mission commands, or using commands from a ground station (GCS) or
companion computer.

The table below shows for each flight mode whether it provides altitude or position control, and whether it requires valid position information from a sensor (typically a GPS) in order to arm or switch into this mode.

Recommended Flight Modes
========================

In general when first starting to use Copter you should progress through
the flight modes in the order listed below, being sure that you are
comfortable with each before progressing to the next (click the links
for more details):

-  :ref:`Stabilize <stabilize-mode>`
-  :ref:`Alt Hold <altholdmode>`
-  :ref:`Loiter <loiter-mode>`
-  :ref:`RTL (Return-to-Launch) <rtl-mode>`
-  :ref:`Auto <auto-mode>`

Additional flight modes:

-  :ref:`Acro <acro-mode>`
-  :ref:`AirMode <airmode>`
-  :ref:`Heli_Autorotate <traditional-helicopter-autorotation-mode>` for traditional helicopters only.
-  :ref:`AutoTune <autotune>`
-  :ref:`Brake <brake-mode>`
-  :ref:`Circle <circle-mode>`
-  :ref:`Drift <drift-mode>`
-  :ref:`Flip <flip-mode>`
-  :ref:`FlowHold <flowhold-mode>`
-  :ref:`Follow <follow-mode>`
-  :ref:`Guided <ac2_guidedmode>` (and :ref:`Guided_NoGPS <guided_nogps>`)
-  :ref:`Land <land-mode>`
-  :ref:`PosHold <poshold-mode>`
-  :ref:`Sport <sport-mode>`
-  :ref:`Throw <throw-mode>`
-  :ref:`Follow Me <ac2_followme>`
-  :ref:`Simple and Super Simple <simpleandsuper-simple-modes>`
-  :ref:`Smart RTL (Return-to-Launch) <smartrtl-mode>`
-  :ref:`SysID (System Identification) <systemid-mode>`
-  :ref:`Turtle <turtle-mode>`
-  :ref:`ZigZag <zigzag-mode>`
-  :ref:`Avoid_ADSB <common-ads-b-receiver>` for ADS-B based avoidance of manned aircraft.  Should not be set-up as a pilot selectable flight mode.

Most transmitters provide a 3 position switch but you can find
instructions :ref:`here for setting up a 6-position flight mode switch <common-rc-transmitter-flight-mode-configuration>`.

GPS Dependency
==============

Flight modes that use positioning data require valid position identification prior to takeoff. When using GPS, to verify if your autopilot has acquired GPS lock,
connect to a ground station or consult your autopilot's hardware
overview page to see the LED indication for GPS lock.

Below is a summary of position identification dependency for Copter flight modes. Most often this position information is obtained via a GPS, but other
position sensors, such as 3D cameras or beacons, may be used and would need to provide a valid location, for those modes requiring it, prior to arming.

Requires valid position prior to takeoff:

-  :ref:`Auto <auto-mode>`
-  :ref:`Heli_Autorotate <traditional-helicopter-autorotation-mode>`
-  :ref:`Circle <circle-mode>`
-  :ref:`Drift <drift-mode>`
-  :ref:`Follow <follow-mode>`
-  :ref:`Follow Me <ac2_followme>`
-  :ref:`Guided <ac2_guidedmode>`
-  :ref:`Loiter <loiter-mode>`
-  :ref:`PosHold <poshold-mode>`
-  :ref:`RTL (Return-to-Launch) <rtl-mode>`
-  :ref:`Smart RTL (Return-to-Launch) <smartrtl-mode>`
-  :ref:`Throw <throw-mode>`
-  :ref:`ZigZag <zigzag-mode>`

Do not require position information:

-  :ref:`Acro <acro-mode>`
-  :ref:`AirMode<airmode>`
-  :ref:`Alt Hold <altholdmode>`
-  :ref:`Stabilize <stabilize-mode>`
-  :ref:`Sport <sport-mode>`
-  :ref:`SysID <systemid-mode>`
-  :ref:`Turtle <turtle-mode>`
-  :ref:`Land <land-mode>`
