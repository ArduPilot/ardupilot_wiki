First-time setup of the autopilot includes downloading and installing a Ground Control Station (GCS), 
mounting the flight controller to the frame,
connecting it to the receiver, power and motors, 
and then performing initial configuration and calibration.

.. note::

   This section assumes that you've already :ref:`chosen and built a frame <choosing-a-frame>` and have
   :ref:`selected your flight controller <common-choosing-a-flight-controller>`.

For more information on each of these tasks (sorted by flight controller
within the sections) see the topics below:
