Mandatory Hardware Configuration
================================

As part of first time setup, you'll need to configure some required
hardware components. The linked articles describe the process for
selecting frame orientation and configuring the RC transmitter/receiver,
compass, and accelerometer using *Mission Planner* and how to configure
the ESCs.

In addition to mandatory calibration, you may also choose to :ref:`Configure Optional Hardware <common-optional-hardware>`
including battery monitor, sonar, airspeed sensor, optical flow, OSD,
camera gimbal, antenna tracker etc.
