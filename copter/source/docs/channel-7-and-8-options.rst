Auxiliary Function Switches
===========================

This article shows how to set up which features are invoked from the transmitter's auxiliary function switches.
AC3.2.1 and earlier allowed channels 7 and 8 to be used as auxiliary switches.  AC3.3 and higher supports channels 7 to 12.

Configuration
=============

By default the auxiliary switches are disabled but you can assign
features using the *Mission Planner*'s **Config/Tuning \| Extended
Tuning** screen or by setting the :ref:`CH7_OPT <CH7_OPT>`, :ref:`CH8_OPT <CH8_OPT>`, :ref:`CH9_OPT <CH9_OPT>`,
:ref:`CH10_OPT <CH10_OPT>`, :ref:`CH11_OPT <CH11_OPT>`, or :ref:`CH12_OPT <CH12_OPT>` parameters directly.

   <td>Vehicle will flip on its roll or pitch axis depending upon the pilot's roll and pitch stick position.
   Vehicle will rise for 1 second and then rapidly flip. The vehicle will not flip again until the switch is
   brought low and back to high. Give yourself at least 10m of altitude before trying flip for the first time!

Similar to simple mode except controls are relative to the home
position. Move the pitch stick forward and the copter will fly away from
home, pull pitch back and it will return. Move roll stick left or right
and the copter to orbit home regardless of the copter's actual
heading. :ref:`See here for more details <simpleandsuper-simple-modes>`.

If mapped to a three-position switch then the function will allow
Super-Simple **and Simple** modes to be enabled using the high and
middle switch positions, respectively (a two-position switch will
enable/disable Super Simple mode only).

Check Ch7 & Ch8 PWM values reach 1800
=====================================

Your channel 7 and/or channel 8 pwm value must reach at least 1800 PWM
or the auxiliary function will not be activated. You can check that it
surpasses this threshold using the Mission Planner's radio config page.
