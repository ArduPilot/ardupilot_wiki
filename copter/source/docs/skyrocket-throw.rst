The SkyViper is such a small frame that is is great for :ref:`Throw Mode <throw-mode>`.
If you want to try throw mode then first read the :ref:`throw mode documentation <throw-mode>`.

Here are some extra tips for throw mode on the SkyViper:

- you can assign throw mode to a button on your TX. Go to the web
  interface at http://192.168.99.1 and choose the parameters
  page. Then assign throw mode to one of the action buttons. I like
  using ACTION5, which you get by holding the MODE button, then
  pressing the right shoulder button (the one marked with the photo
  icon)
- wait till you have full GPS lock (green LED on transmitter is solid)
- with your skyviper disarmed and on the ground, select throw mode
  with the button you have setup in the first step. You will hear a
  bip-boop-bip sound from the TX
- now press the "return" button to arm your copter. The motors will
  not start spinning.
- look at your transmitter LEDs. If the green LED is flashing rapidly
  then you are ready to throw. Do not throw the copter unless the
  green LED is flashing rapidly
- pickup the copter by one of the legs, keeping fingers clear of the
  propellers
- throw it as high as you can with one smooth motion
- do NOT swing your arm back and forward to "wind up" for the throw,
  otherwise the copter may think the throw has been done and will
  start the motors
- be ready to press the power button on the TX for instant disarm if
  something goes wrong
- after the throw, the copter will take a few seconds to settle, then
  will automatically switch to LOITER mode for you to fly it
