Traditional Helicopter â€“ Tuning
===============================

This guide is broken out for manual and autotune tuning techniques.  Both tuning techniques will require the user to perform the initial setup steps.

.. warning:: For making setting changes to traditional helicopters, users are reminded to use only the Full or Complete Parameter List, or the Heli SETUP page in your ground station software. **Do not use the Basic, Extended or Advanced Tuning pages that are designed for multi-rotor aircraft in Mission Planner.** These pages will make unwanted setting changes to traditional helicopters. And remember to write the changes to the flight controller after making them or they won't be saved!

.. note:: If the reader is unfamiliar with PID control systems then reading :ref:`traditional-helicopter-control-system` is recommended.
