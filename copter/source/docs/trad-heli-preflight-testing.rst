Traditional Helicopter - Pre-Flight Testing
===========================================

Before your first flight, please follow these pre-flight checks:

.. warning::

   The drive should be disconnected on electric helicopters when they are
   being handled. An accidental startup can cause serious injury.

-  Ensure the USB connector is disconnected from the Pixhawk
-  Connect the battery to power the Pixhawk and servos

Test leaning the helicopter in Stabilize mode
=============================================

-  By hand, roll the helicopter to the left. The swash plate should lean
   to the right.
-  Roll the helicopter to the right. The swash plate should lean to the
   left.
-  Pitch the helicopter down (i.e. nose down). The swash plate should
   lean backwards.
-  Pitch the helicopter up (i.e. nose up). The swash plate should lean
   forwards.
-  Rotate the helicopter quickly clockwise - the tail servo should move
   as if you had pushed the rudder control left (i.e. it's should try to
   fight against the rotation)
-  Rotate the helicopter quickly counter-clockwise - the tail servo
   should move as if you had pushed the rudder control right (i.e. it's
   should try to fight against the rotation)
-  Next rotate the helicopter slowly. You should find that in a certain
   direction the rudder stays in the middle.

Test the transmitter in Stabilize mode
======================================

-  Using the transmitter, move the roll stick to the left. The
   swashplate should lean slightly to the left.
-  move the roll stick to the right. The swashplate should lean slightly
   to the right.
-  Move the pitch stick forward. The swashplate should lean slightly
   forward.
-  Move the pitch stick back. The swashplate should lean slightly
   backwards.
-  Move the yaw stick to the left or right. The tail should move in the
   same direction (and about the same amount) as when you are in manual
   mode.
