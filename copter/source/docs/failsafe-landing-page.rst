Failsafe
========

Copter has a number of failsafe mechanisms to ease vehicle
recovery/prevent wandering in the event that vehicle control is lost.
The main failsafe topics are listed below.

.. note:: Once a Radio Failsafe, Battery Failsafe, GCS Failsafe or Terrain Data Loss Failsafe is entered and the failsafe action taken involves a mode change to the vehicle, it remain in that mode until the pilot changes the mode directly.
