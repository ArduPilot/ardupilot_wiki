Motor Thrust Scaling
====================

Copter includes *motor thrust scaling* which compensates for the
non-linear thrust output of most ESCs and motors. 

.. tip::

    The default curve should work for nearly all ESC/motor combinations. 
    Normally the parameters should not be adjusted unless the vehicleâ€™s actual 
    thrust curve has been measured.

Thrust Curves
=============

The curve is controlled by two parameters:

-  :ref:`MOT_THST_EXPO<MOT_THST_EXPO>` controls the shape of the thrust curve with "0"
   meaning a completely linear curve and "1.0" being very curved (see
   pictures below).  The default is "0.65" (the image below incorrectly
   states the default is 0.5).

.. warning:: Some ESCs have built-in linearizing curves and the default EXPO value of "0.65" will cause stability issues, requiring thrust stand measurements to adjust the EXPO. Typically, values of "0" to "0.2" will result.

-  :ref:`MOT_SPIN_MAX<MOT_SPIN_MAX>` controls the point at which the thrust flattens
   out near its maximum.  By default this is 0.95 meaning 95% of full
   throttle.

Thrust Stands
=============

The thrust stands listed below can be used to measure the PWM signal vs thrust output for a vehicle's specific motor, esc and battery. Be sure to use the ESCs rated input PWM range when measuring these values.
