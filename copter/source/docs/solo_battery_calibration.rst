3DR Solo - Smart Battery Calibration
====================================

The Solo Smart Battery may need recalibration from time to time.  The following write up details how execute a recalibration of the BMS.


1. Gently discharge the battery pack until it cuts off the first time (this is around 12V).
2. Allow the pack the relax for at least 5 hours.  The pack's voltage will climb above 12V during this process.  **DO NOT TRY TO DISCHARGE THE PACK AGAIN.**  Damage to the battery may result.
3. Charge the pack completely and leave it on the charger for 48 hours.  The pack will relax, then do a balance cycle, then top off.
4. Let the pack sit for at least 2 hours off the charger before using the pack.
