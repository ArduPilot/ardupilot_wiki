Parrot Bebop Autopilot
======================

The Parrot `Bebop2 <https://www.parrot.com/global/drones/parrot-bebop-2-fpv>`__ is a Wifi controlled quadrotor UAV that uses a Linux autopilot which can run ArduPilot firmware.  
Instructions for converting a Bebop to run ArduPilot are :ref:`here <dev:building-for-bebop-2>`.  
We recommend the Bebop2 over the original Bebop because of its much improved GPS.

.. note::

   Copter support was added in Copter-3.3.
