When assembling your copter, we recommend using threadlocker on all
motor mount screws. For more information on using and applying
threadlocker, check out `this video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaO3wL3Ypqg>`__. When securing
wiring, keep positive and negative wires close together, use zip ties to
secure wiring to frame, and use cable mesh where possible. Use a
vibration dampening strategy as described in the :ref:`Vibration Dampening and Isolation page <common-vibration-damping>`.
