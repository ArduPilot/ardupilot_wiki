Land Mode
=========

LAND Mode attempts to bring the copter straight down and has these
features:

-  descends to 10m (or until the sonar senses something below the
   copter) using the regular Altitude Hold controller which will descend
   at the speed held in the WPNAV_SPEED_DN parameter which can be
   modified on the Mission Planner's Config/Tuning > Copter Pids screen.

       :target: ../_images/Land_DescentSpeed1.png

-  below 10m the copter should descend at the rate specified in the
   LAND_SPEED parameter which defaults to 50cm/s.

       :target: ../_images/Land_DescentSpeed2.png

-  Upon reaching the ground the copter will automatically shut-down the
   motors and disarm the copter if the pilot's throttle is at minimum.

.. note::

    Copter will recognise that it has landed if the motors are at
    minimum but it's climb rate remains between -20cm/s and +20cm/s for one
    second.  It does not use the altitude to decide whether to shut off the
    motors except that the copter must also be below 10m above the home
    altitude.

-  If the copter appears to bounce or balloon back up a couple of times
   before settling down and turning the props off, try lowering the
   LAND_SPEED parameter a bit.
-  If the vehicle has GPS lock the landing controller will attempt to
   control it's horizontal position but the pilot can adjust the target
   horizontal position just as in Loiter mode.
-  If the vehicle does not have GPS lock the horizontal control will be
   as in stabilize mode so the pilot can control the roll and pitch lean
   angle of the copter.


.. warning::

    In any Alt Hold based mode including: Alt Hold, Loiter,
    Auto, AutoLand or RTL if your copters operation becomes erratic when you
    are close to the ground or landing (and also if any auto landing
    procedure results in bouncing or failure to turn off motors properly
    after landing) you probably have the fight controller situated such that
    it's barometer (altimeter) is being affected by the pressure created by
    the copters prop-wash against the ground.



-  This is easily verified by looking at the Altimeter reading in your
   logs and seeing if it spikes or oscillates when near the ground.
-  If this is a problem, move the flight controller out of prop wash
   effect or shield it with an appropriately ventilated enclosure.
-  Success can be verified by flight test and by log results.
