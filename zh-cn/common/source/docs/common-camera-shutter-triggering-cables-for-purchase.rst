Camera Shutter Trigger Boards/Cables for Purchase
=================================================

This article provides links to cables/boards that can be used for
triggering the camera shutter from ArduPilot.

Overview
========

ArduPilot allows you to :ref:`configure a servo or relay output as the control signal for the camera shutter <common-camera-shutter-with-servo>` so that it can be used in
:ref:`Camera Missions <common-camera-control-and-auto-missions-in-mission-planner>`.
Additional hardware is required to convert the shutter activation signal
to the format expected by the particular camera.

This article contains links to information about camera cables and
boards that can be used for this purpose.

.. tip::

   Please add new boards/cables you discover to this page (or `request the addition <https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot_wiki/issues/new>`__).

output set in the :ref:`Camera Shutter Configuration <common-camera-shutter-with-servo>` in Mission Planner.
