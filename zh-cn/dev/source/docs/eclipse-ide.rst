Eclipse is the recommended editor for ArduPilot development on Windows.

The easiest way to set up Eclipse for ArduPilot development is to use
the version (Eclipse "Luna") included with the PX4 Toolchain (this
version can be used for both Pixhaw/PX4 and APM development).
Instructions for the different controller boards are given below:

-  :ref:`Building ArduPilot for APM2.x with Eclipse on Windows <building-apm2-with-eclipse-on-windows>`
-  :ref:`Building for Pixhawk/PX4 using Eclipse on Windows <editing-the-code-with-eclipse>`
