Loiter Mode
===========

Loiter Mode automatically attempts to maintain the current location,
heading and altitude. The pilot may fly the copter in Loiter mode as if
it were in manual. Releasing the sticks will continue to hold position.

Good GPS position, :ref:`low magnetic interference on the compass <common-diagnosing-problems-using-logs_compass_interference>`\ and
:ref:`low vibrations <common-diagnosing-problems-using-logs_vibrations>`
are all important in achieving good loiter performance.

Controls
========

The pilot can control the copter's position with the control sticks.

-  Horizontal location can be adjusted with the the Roll and Pitch
   control sticks with the default maximum horizontal speed being 5m/s
   (see Tuning section below on how to adjust this).  When the pilot
   releases the sticks the copter will slow to a stop.
-  Altitude can be controlled with the Throttle control stick just as in
   :ref:`AltHold mode <altholdmode_controls>`
-  The heading can be set with the Yaw control stick

In AC3.1 (and above) you may arm in Loiter mode but only once the GPS
has 3D lock and the HDOP has dropped to 2.0 or lower.

On an APM2 the board's blue light will become solid when 3D lock is
attained.  On a Pixhawk the LED will become green (:ref:`more details on LED patterns here <common-apm-board-leds>`).

The HDOP value can be made clearly visible through the mission planner's
Quick screen by double clicking and then selecting "gpshdop" from the
large grid of checkboxes.

Tuning
======

.. image:: ../images/Loiter_Tuning.png
    :target: ../_images/Loiter_Tuning.png

Loiter mode incorporates the altitude controller from AltHold mode. 
Details for tuning :ref:`AltHold are on this wiki page <altholdmode_tuning>`.

**WPNAV_LOIT_SPEED** : max horizontal speed in cm/s.  I.e. 500 =
5m/s.  The maximum acceleration during Loiter mode is always 1/2 of the
Loiter speed.

**WPNAV_LOIT_JERK**: max change in acceleration in cm/s/s/s.  Higher
numbers will make the vehicle more responsive, lower numbers will make
it smoother.

**WPNAV_LOIT_MAXA** : max acceleration in cm/s/s.  Higher values cause
the copter to accelerate and stop more quickly.

**WPNAV_LOIT_MINA** : min acceleration in cm/s/s.  Higher values stop
the copter more quickly when the stick is centered, but cause a larger
jerk when the copter stops..

**POS_XY_P** (shown as "Loiter PID P" at the top right of the screen
shot above) convert the horizontal position error (i.e difference
between the desired position and the actual position) to a desired speed
towards the target position.  **It is generally not required to adjust
this.**

**VEL_XY_P** (shown as "Rate Loiter P, I and D") convert the desired
speed towards the target to a desired acceleration.  The resulting
desired acceleration becomes a lean angle which is then passed to the
same angular controller used by :ref:`Stabilize mode <stabilize-mode>`. 
**It is generally not required to adjust this.**

Verifying Loiter performance with dataflash logs
================================================

Viewing the loiter's horizontal performance is best done by :ref:`downloading a dataflash log <common-downloading-and-analyzing-data-logs-in-mission-planner>`
from your flight, then open it with the mission planner and graph the
NTUN messageâ€™s DesVelX vs VelX and DesVelY vs VelY.  In a good
performing copter the acxtual velocities will track the desired
velocities as shown below.  X = latitude (so positive = moving North,
negative = South), Y = longitude (positive = East, negative = West).

Checking altitude hold performance is the same as for
:ref:`AltHold <altholdmode_verifying_althold_performance_with_dataflash_logs>`
mode.

Common Problems
===============

As mentioned above, Loiter mode incorporates the altitude controller
from AltHold mode.  Alt hold issues are on the :ref:`AltHold wiki page <altholdmode_common_problems>`.

#. The vehicle `circles (aka "toiletbowls") <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-3G9ZvXHhk>`__.  This
   is normally caused by a compass problem the most likely being
   :ref:`magnetic interference <common-diagnosing-problems-using-logs_compass_interference>`
   from the power cables under the flight controller.  Running
   :ref:`compassmot <common-compass-setup-advanced_compassmot_compensation_for_interference_from_the_power_wires_escs_and_motors>`
   or purchasing a :ref:`GPS+compass module <common-installing-3dr-ublox-gps-compass-module>` normal
   resolves this.  Other possibilities include bad compass offsets set
   during the :ref:`live calibration process <common-compass-calibration-in-mission-planner>` or
   incorrect compass orientation.
#. The vehicle takes off in the wrong direction as soon as loiter is
   engaged.  The cause is the same as #1 except that the compass error
   is greater than 90deg.  Please try the suggestions above to resolve
   this.
#. The vehicle is loitering normally and then suddenly takes off in the
   wrong direction.  This is generally caused by a :ref:`GPS Glitch <gps-failsafe-glitch-protection>`.  
   There is no 100% reliable protection
   against these which means the pilot should always be ready to
   take-over manual control.  Beyond that ensuring a good GPS HDOP
   before take-off is always good and it may help to reduce the
   GPSGLITCH_RADIUS and/or GPSGLITCH_ACCEL parameters (see :ref:`GPS glitch wiki page <gps-failsafe-glitch-protection>` 
   for details) to tighten up on the glitch detection.

OF_LOITER Mode
===============

OF_LOITER is a special version of Loiter mode that will use the Optical
Flow device to maintain position. It is not yet implemented but work is
ongoing. Do Not select OF_LOITER mode until an update of Copter
specifies that it is installed and working.
