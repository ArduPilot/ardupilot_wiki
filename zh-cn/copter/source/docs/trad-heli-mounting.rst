Traditional Helicopter â€“ Mounting APM/Pixhawk to the Frame
==========================================================

The recommended method for mounting your APM/Pixhawk is to build an
extra layer for the APM/Pixhawk between the main body and the landing
gear as show in the image below.

-  Separate the helicopter's main body from it's landing gear
-  Attach one carbon fibre plate to the body, the other to the landing
   gear
-  Drill holes in the upper and lower mounting plates so that the plates
   can be attached with four strong 3cm or 4cm stand-offs
-  Mount the APM/Pixhawk to the bottom mounting plate using vibration
   dampening foam (see :ref:`Vibration Dampening wiki page <common-vibration-damping>` for ideas on mounting methods to
   isolate the flight controller from vibrations)
