Traditional Helicopter – Loading the Firmware
=============================================

The easiest way to load the latest code is by using the Mission Planner
much like you would for a
:ref:`quad <common-loading-firmware-onto-pixhawk>`.
You can get the latest Mission Planner by following the topic
:ref:`Installing Mission Planner <common-install-mission-planner>`.
The only difference being that after you click on the "Firmware" button,
you click on the helicopter icon.

Developers may also want to build the code and upload their own
firmware. See the :ref:`Developer wiki <dev:home>` for
more information.
