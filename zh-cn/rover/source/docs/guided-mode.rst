.. _guided-mode:

===========
GUIDED mode
===========

-  Does not require a dedicated switch, so don't select it as a flight
   mode.
-  It may currently require the "flight altitude" to be set to zero.
-  Allows you to use a **:ref:`Telemetry Radio <common-telemetry-landingpage>`** to specify waypoints on a
   map in mission planner.
-  And "tell" the Rover to go to those waypoints.
-  See the **:ref:`APMCopter Guided Mode Description <copter:ac2_guidedmode>`**
   for a overview of how it works.
