AUTO Mode
=========

Follow a course of Waypoints generated in while driving in :ref:`Learning mode <learning-mode>` or from a loaded waypoint list.

-  Waypoint lists can also be generated with APM mission planner and
   uploaded to APM via the Flight Planner screen.
-  Rover loops the waypoint lists stored in memory.
-  Momentary toggle (CH7) triggers immediate RTL (return to launch
   point: Home position), enters HOLD mode after completing RTL.
-  To regain manual control of the rover, switch back to
   :ref:`LEARNING <learning-mode>` or :ref:`MANUAL <manual-mode>` mode.
-  In Auto mode if RC reception is lost, the controller will
   automatically switch to :ref:`HOLD <hold-mode>` mode.
