Relay Switch
============

A "Relay" is an digital output pin on the APM or Pixhawk that can be
switched between 0 volts and either 3.3V (Pixhawk) or 5V (APM2). 
Similar to a servo it allows the flight controller to invoke some action
from another device on the vehicle.  In Copter, Plane and Rover, up to 4
pins can be defined as relays.

Relay pins on the Pixhawk
=========================

On the Pixhawk AUX OUT 5 (pin 54) and AUX OUT 6 (pin 55) are setup as
the "First" (or #0) and "Second" (or #1) Relays respectively.

The number of available Relays can be increased to a maximum of 6 by
reducing the number of AUX pins used as :ref:`Servo <common-servo>`
outputs.  This can be accomplished by reducing the BRD_PWM_COUNT from
4 to 2 or 0.

Relay pins on the APM2
======================

On the APM2, A9 (pin 9) is the pin that is recommended to be used as a
relay.  In fact any of the pins from A0 ~ A8 may also be used as relays
but to use these you must manually set the RELAY_PIN parameter (to "0"
~ "8") through the Mission Planner's full parameter list.

Defining the relay pins through the Mission Planner
===================================================

The First ~ Fourth relay pins can be defined most easily using the
Mission Planner's Config/Tuning screen's Standard Params list as shown
below.  Alternatively if you know the exactly pin number to use, the
RELAY_PIN parameter can be set directly through the mission planner's
Full Parameters List.

Pilot control of the relay
==========================

On Copter 3.2 (and higher) the "First" relay can be controlled with the
Ch7/Ch8 switches.

Mission control of the relay
============================

Similar to a servo, the Relays can be activated during a mission using
the Do-Set-Relay mission command.  This is described on the :ref:`Copter Mission Command List wiki page <copter:mission-command-list_do-set-relay>`.
