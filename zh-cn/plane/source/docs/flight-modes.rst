Flight Modes

This article provides links to Plane's flight modes.

Overview
========

Plane has a wide range of built in flight modes. Plane can act as a
simple flight stabilization system, a sophisticated autopilot, a
training system or a flight safety system depending on what flight mode
and options you choose.

Flight modes are controlled through a :ref:`radio transmitter switch <common-rc-transmitter-flight-mode-configuration>`, via mission
commands, or using commands from a ground station (GCS) or companion
computer.

Major Flight Modes
==================

All of the flight modes below have optional additional controls that may
be used to change the behaviour to suit particular flying needs. After
you have read the introductory material below it is highly recommended
that you look through the complete set of :doc:`Plane parameters <parameters>` so you can explore the full range
of functionality available.

:ref:`MANUAL <manual-mode>`

:ref:`STABILIZE <stabilize-mode>`

:ref:`FLY BY WIRE_A (FBWA) <fbwa-mode>`

:ref:`FLY BY WIRE_B (FBWB) <fbwb-mode>`

:ref:`AUTOTUNE <autotune-mode>`

:ref:`TRAINING <training-mode>`

:ref:`ACRO <acro-mode>`

:ref:`CRUISE <cruise-mode>`

:ref:`AUTO <auto-mode>`

:ref:`Return To Launch (RTL) <rtl-mode>`

:ref:`LOITER <loiter-mode>`

:ref:`CIRCLE <circle-mode>`

:ref:`GUIDED <guided-mode>`

Mission Specific Modes
======================

When flying an AUTO mission Plane has some sub-modes that are set using
mission items. The two main sub-modes are TAKEOFF and LAND.

:ref:`TAKEOFF <takeoff-mode>`

:ref:`LAND <land-mode>`
