3DRobotics
==========

We owe an enormous debt of gratitude to `3DR <https://3dr.com/>`__ (a.k.a. "3DRobotics") for sponsoring the ArduPilot project and community over a number of years. This sponsorship paid the salaries of the core development team, provided the hosting infrastructure for the project websites, and provided hardware as needed.

Thank you 3DR - we wouldn't be the world-leading open source autopilot we are without you!
