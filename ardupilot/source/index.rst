    Success with ArduPilot requires that the 'First Time Setup' and 'First Flight/Drive and Tuning' sections of the vehicle's documentation be read and followed!</strong>

    <p style="text-align:left; color:black;">

    ArduPilot enables the creation and use of trusted, autonomous,
    unmanned vehicle systems for the peaceful benefit of
    all. ArduPilot provides a comprehensive suite of tools suitable
    for almost any vehicle and application. As an open source project,
    it is constantly evolving based on rapid feedback from a large
    community of users. The Development Team works with the community
    and commercial partners to add functionality to ArduPilot that
    benefits everyone. Although ArduPilot does not manufacture any
    hardware, ArduPilot firmware works on a wide variety of different
    hardware to control unmanned vehicles of all types. Coupled with
    ground control software, unmanned vehicles running ArduPilot can
    have advanced functionality including real-time communication with
    operators. ArduPilot has a huge online community dedicated to
    helping users with questions, problems, and solutions </p>

:ref:`Hardware <stores>`  is the peripheral sensors, controller, and output
devices that act as the vehicle's eyes, ears, brain and arms.

Almost any mobile machine can be transformed into an autonomous vehicle,
by simply integrating a small hardware package into it. Hardware
packages begin with a controller.

Using inputs from sensors, the controller is able to send outputs to
devices such as ESC's, servos, gimbals and other peripherals.

:ref:`Firmware <common-downloads_firmware>`- is the code running on the controller.
You choose the firmware to match your vehicle and mission: :ref:`Copter <copter:home>`, `Plane <https://ardupilot.org/plane/index.html>`__,
:ref:`Rover <rover:home>`, Sub, or :ref:`Antenna Tracker <antennatracker:home>`.

The choice is yours -- one autopilot for any mission.

:ref:`Software <common-choosing-a-ground-station>` is your interface to the
controller. Also called a Ground Control Station (GCS), the software can run
on PC's or mobile devices.

A GCS allows users to set-up, configure, test, and tune the vehicle. Advanced
packages allow autonomous mission planning, operation,
and post-mission analysis.

:ref:`Mission Planner <planner:home>` is a full-featured GCS supported by ArduPilot. It offers
point-and-click interaction with your hardware, custom scripting, and simulation.

ArduPilot Documentation
=======================

See sidebar for links to ArduPilot documents.

Quickstart
==========

- Select your vehicle type to the left
- Select your "AutoPilot Hardware" and "Peripheral Hardware" for your application
- Follow vehicle's "First Time Setup"  for installing the firmware and Ground Station software, connecting the components, and calibration steps
- Prepare for "First Flight(/Drive)" completing setup prior to first flight/drive
- Advanced Configuration offers setup of more advanced features of the firmware and hardware peripherals

Regulations
===========

Every country has different regulations governing the operation of remote controlled and/or autonomous vehicles. `This database <https://droneregulations.info>`__  has country specific information, but it is every operator's responsibility to be seek out and be aware of local, regional, and federal regulations.

History
=======

The DIYDrones community provided an initial home for ArduPilot.
From those hobbyist beginnings, ArduPilot led the professionalisation of the Open Source drone community by creating DroneCode.
Since leaving DroneCode in 2016 ArduPilot has grown further to stand as an independent, open, global project.
The comprehensive and ever growing list of ArduPilot features are continually born from the
needs of the community - be they hobbyists, commercial users, academics, or the largest of enterprises.
See the :ref:`history-of-ardupilot` for more information.
