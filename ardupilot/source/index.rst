    <h1 style="text-align:center;">ArduPilot</h1>

    <p style="text-align:left;">ArduPilot aims to enable the creation and use of trusted, autonomous, unmanned vehicle systems for the peaceful benefit of all. Ardupilot is a project that can currently be described as an autopilot suite. As an open source project, it is constantly evolving and being developed. The development "DEV" team uses the community and commercial partners to add functionality to ardupilot that benefits everyone. Although ardupilot does not manufacture any hardware, ardupilot firmware works on many different boards (hardware) to control unmanned vehicles of all types. Coupled with ground control software, unmanned vehicles running ardupilot can have advanced functionality including real-time communication with operators. Ardupilot has the largest community dedicated to helping users with questions, problems, and solutions</p>

:ref:`Hardware <stores>`  is the peripheral sensors, controller, and output
devices that act as the vehicle's eyes, ears, brain, arms etc.

Almost any mobile machine can be transformed into an autonomous vehicle, 
by simply integrating a small hardware package into it. Hardware 
packages begin with a controller.

Using inputs from sensors, the controller is able to send outputs to 
devices such as ESC's, servos, gimbals, etc.

:ref:`Firmware <common-downloads_firmware>`- is the code or "skill set"
running on the controller. You choose the firmware to match your vehicle and
mission: :ref:`Copter <copter:home>`, :ref:`Plane <plane:home>`,
:ref:`Rover <rover:home>`, Sub, or :ref:`Antenna Tracker <antennatracker:home>`.

The choice is yours -- one autopilot for any mission. A firmware
update is all it takes to repurpose your hardware into a different role.

:ref:`Software <common-choosing-a-ground-station>` is your interface to the
controller. Also called a Ground Control Station (GCS), the software can run
on PC's or mobile devices.

A GCS allows users to set-up, configure, test, and tune the vehicle. Advanced
packages allow autonomous mission planning, operation,
and post-mission analysis.

:ref:`Mission Planner <planner:home>` is a full-featured GCS supported by Ardupilot. It offers
point-and-click interaction with your hardware, custom scripting, and simulation.
