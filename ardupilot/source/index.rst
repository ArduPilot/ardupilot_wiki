:ref:`Hardware <stores>` - The embedded systems and
peripheral sensors that act as the vehicle's brain, eyes, ears, etc.

Almost any mobile machine can be transformed into a robot, by simply
integrating a small hardware package into it.

:ref:`Firmware <common-downloads_firmware>`- The "skill set" code
running on the hardware, which configures it for the kind of vehicle
you've put it in. You choose the firmware and vehicle that match your
mission: :ref:`Plane <plane:home>`, :ref:`Copter <copter:home>`,
:ref:`Rover <rover:home>`...

The choice is yours -- one autopilot for any mission. An easy firmware
update is all it takes to repurpose your hardware into a different role.

:ref:`Software <planner:home>`- Your interface to the
hardware.

Initial set-up, configuration, and testing. Mission-planning/operation,
and post-mission analysis.

Point-and-click intuitive interaction with your hardware, or advanced
custom scripting for niche mission profiles. Options are everything with
ArduPilot.
