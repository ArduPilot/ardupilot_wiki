The *AntennaTracker* Project delivers firmware which allows you to use a
supported flight controller board as the
controller for an Antenna Tracker.

The tracker calculates the position of a remote vehicle using its own
GPS position and GPS telemetry from a vehicle running Copter, Rover or
Plane. It then uses this information to aim a directional antenna at
the vehicle.

Using a correctly aligned directional antenna *significantly improves* 
the range over which signals can be both sent and received from
a ground station.

If your a developer wanting to work on AntennaTracker please join the
ArduPilot Discord chat channel which can be found in the Community menu
above.

If your a user looking for support on the AntennaTracker please go to
