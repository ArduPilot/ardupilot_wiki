The *AntennaTracker* Project offers firmware for using a supported flight controller board as an Antenna Tracker. 
This tracker determines the position of a remote vehicle via its own GPS data and telemetry data from a Copter, Rover, or Plane, and uses this information to align a directional antenna towards the vehicle. 
Such alignment *significantly* enhances the transmission and reception range from a ground station.

Developers interested in AntennaTracker are invited to join the ArduPilot Discord channel accessible in the Community menu. 
Users seeking AntennaTracker support should refer to the support forums under the same menu. 
This manual serves as a guide for setup and configuration.
