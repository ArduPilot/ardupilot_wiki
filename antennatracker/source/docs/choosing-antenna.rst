Choosing an Antenna
===================

Your choice of directional antenna will most likely be based upon:

-  size and weight limitations
-  desired transmission distance
-  radio frequency (the antenna should be designed for the radio's frequency)
-  cost

Antenna dBi and transmission distance
=====================================

Antennas with higher dBi values will be able to transmit further. A
general rule of thumb (gathered from
`fpvlab.com <http://fpvlab.com/forums/showthread.php?4683-Formula-to-calculate-distance-from-antennas-gains&p=78052&viewfull=1#post78052>`__
and `zytrax.com <http://www.zytrax.com/tech/wireless/calc.htm>`__) is:

-  increasing the antenna gain by 6dBi (i.e. from 2dBi to 8dBi) will double the range
-  increasing the transmitter power by 4x (i.e. from 20mW to 80mW) will double the range

The standard :ref:`3DR radio <copter:common-sik-telemetry-radio>` comes with a 2dBi antenna.
