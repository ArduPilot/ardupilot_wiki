===============================================
Setting up the Build Environment (Linux/Ubuntu)
===============================================

This article shows how to setup your build environment on Linux/Ubuntu machines.

Setup on Ubuntu
===============

Clone ArduPilot repository
--------------------------

.. include:: git-clone.rst
    :start-after: inclusion-marker-do-not-remove
    :end-before: Cloning with the GitHub GUI (Windows or MAC)

Install some required packages
------------------------------

If you are on a debian based system (such as Ubuntu or Mint), we provide `a script <https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot/blob/master/Tools/scripts/install-prereqs-ubuntu.sh>`__ that will do it for you. From ardupilot directory :
::

    Tools/scripts/install-prereqs-ubuntu.sh -y

Reload the path (log-out and log-in to make permanent):

::

    . ~/.profile

Now you should be able to build with waf as described in `BUILD.md <https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot/blob/master/BUILD.md>`__.

Add some directories to your search path (Facultative)
------------------------------------------------------

.. note::

    ONLY if you didn't run the install-prereqs script from previous step.

Add the following lines to the end of your ".bashrc" in your home
directory (notice the . on the start of that filename. Also, this is a
hidden file, so if you're using a file manager, make sure to turn on
"show hidden files").

::

    export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/ardupilot/Tools/autotest
    export PATH=/usr/lib/ccache:$PATH

Then reload your PATH by using the "dot" command in a terminal

::

    . ~/.bashrc

Setup for other Distributions
=============================

.. warning::

    Do not use this if you have already use the ``install-prereqs-ubuntu.sh`` script !

To build for a Cube/Pixhawk target on Linux you need the
following tools and git repositories:

-  The gcc-arm cross-compiler from `here <http://firmware.ardupilot.org/Tools/STM32-tools/>`__
-  gnu make, gawk and associated standard Linux build tools
-  On a 64 bit system you will also need to have installed libc6-i386.

Also, it's worth mentioning here that you want to ensure that the
modemmanager package is not installed and the modem-manager process is
not running.

Permissions
-----------

You need to make your user a member of the dialout group:

::

    sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER

You will need to log out and then log back in for the group change to take effect.

Compiler
--------

You need the specific gcc-arm cross-compiler linked above. You need to unpack it where you want, for now let's call this location TARGET_DIR:

::

    cd TARGET_DIR
    tar -xjvf gcc-arm-none-eabi-4_9-2015q3-20150921-linux.tar.bz2

and then add the bin directory from the tarball to your $PATH by editing
the $HOME/.bashrc file and adding a line like this to the end. TARGET_DIR is the location choose previouly where you unpack the toolchain:

``export PATH=$PATH:TARGET_DIR/gcc-arm-none-eabi-4_9-2015q3/bin``

Now you should be able to build with waf as described in `BUILD.md <https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot/blob/master/BUILD.md>`__.

ccache for faster builds
------------------------

Installing *ccache* will speed up your builds a lot. Once you install it
(for example with "sudo apt-get install ccache") you should link the
compiler into /usr/lib/ccache like this:

::

    cd /usr/lib/ccache
    sudo ln -s /usr/bin/ccache arm-none-eabi-g++
    sudo ln -s /usr/bin/ccache arm-none-eabi-gcc

Then add /usr/lib/ccache to the front of your $PATH

Cleaning
--------

If there have been updates to some git submodules you may need to do a full clean build. To do that use:

::

    make px4-clean

that will remove the *PX4NuttX* archives so you can do a `build <https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot/blob/master/BUILD.md>`__ from scratch


Additional Steps for macOS mojave
---------------------------------
Due to some changes binutils installed via brew have stopped working for macOS mojave leading to crashing builds. So if installed, remove via following command:

::

    brew uninstall binutils

Also you will need to install the c++ include headers to /usr/include to do that. Run the following in commandline and follow the installation routine:

::

    open /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Packages/macOS_SDK_headers_for_macOS_10.14.pkg
