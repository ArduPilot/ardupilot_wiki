Real time voice chat on Mumble
==============================

The ArduPilot dev team uses a mumble server for real-time voice chat.

.. note::

   The channel is for development discussions only. Please don't use
   it as a user help channel.

You can join the chat at any time:

-  server: mumble.dronecode.org
-  port: 10028
-  software: http://mumble.sf.net

**Please note that the port number is NOT the default mumble port
number. If you find an empty server then please check your port number**

Usernames
---------

When you first join the server it will ask you to choose a username.
Please choose something like *FirstnameLastname*. The user name must not
have any spaces.

Weekly dev calls
----------------

We have a weekly development call.  Please see https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=umliaon4e095pmct59kbae9v7c%40group.calendar.google.com for the time and drones-discuss mailing list for agenda and minutes. The call is held in
the "Weekly Dev Call" channel on mumble.

We don't record the calls, and we would ask you not to record them
yourself. Minutes will be posted to the drones-discuss list after the
meeting.

In the audio configuration section please select Push to Talk and use a
headset to reduce noise on the call.

General Chat
------------

We have a "General Discussion" channel for chatting about ArduPilot
development at any time. How many developers are connected depends a lot
on timezones.
