Google Summer of Docs (GSoD) 2019 Project Ideas
===============================================

This is a list of projects suggested by ArduPilot developers for Google Summer Of Docs 2019.
These are only suggestions, and if you have your own ideas then please discuss them on the `ArduPilot GSOC gitter channel <https://gitter.im/ArduPilot/GSoC>`__.
The successful candidate(s) will be mentored by one of the project leads who can provide the required detail of the project.

- Bring our `Plane wiki <http://ardupilot.org/plane/index.html>`__ up to the same level as Copter and Rover
- Improve images on our wiki by using transparent background (instead of white) or completely replacing with more professional looking images
- Fill out developer `MAVLink interface <http://ardupilot.org/dev/docs/mavlink-commands.html>`__ with help from one of the core developers
- Create a better "Getting Started" section of the Copter wiki for users new to ArduPilot

How to improve your chances of being accepted
=============================================

When making the difficult decision about which students to accept, we look for:

- Clear and detailed application explaining how you think the project could be done
- Relevant prior experience
- Experience contributing to ArduPilot or other open source projects
- Understanding of Git and/or GitHub or other code repository systems (this is where we keep our documents)
