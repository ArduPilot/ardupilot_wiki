Learning the ArduPilot Codebase
===============================

The ArduPilot code base is quite large (about 700k lines for the core
ardupilot git tree) and can be quite intimidating to a new user. This
page is meant to give some suggestions on how to come up to speed on the
code quickly. It assumes you already are familiar with the key concepts
of C++ and the many of the examples currently assume you will be
exploring the code on a Linux system.

This page and the pages linked below are designed to be used as a
tutorial. You should work through each page step by step, trying things
for yourself as you go. If you think some important information is missing or could be improved
then please `open an issue for the wiki <https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot_wiki/issues>`__ and we will try to get to it when we can.

.. note::

   There are currently five vehicles in ArduPilot (Copter, Plane, Rover, Sub, and Antenna Tracker) and while there are a lot of common elements between different vehicle types, they are each different. For now we only have a detailed description of the code structure for the Copter code.
