ArduPilot Discord Server
========================

The ArduPilot dev team uses `Discord <https://ardupilot.org/discord>`__ for real-time voice chat.  We have a "General Discussion" channel for chatting about ArduPilot development at any time. How many developers are connected depends a lot on timezones.  Don't be shy about your English language ability, we have developers from all over the world.

.. note::

   The channel is for development discussions only. Please don't use it as a user help channel.
   We don't record the calls, and we would ask you not to record them yourself.

Installing and Connecting

- Discord is available both as a web and installed application.  Use the provided link in the first instance.

When you first join the server it will ask you to choose a username. Please choose something like *FirstnameLastname*.

Weekly dev calls
----------------

The weekly development call is held on Discord in the "Weekly Dev Call" channel.  The agenda and minutes are normally sent to discuss.ardupilot.org.
Time of the meeting is: 2300 UTC each Monday.

A second development call is held at a time more convenient for the European community.
This meeting is held each Wednesday at 0700 UTC.

A calendar with the meetings can be found at https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=rgdbom27tb1vlo62kjjnmt8va4%40group.calendar.google.com which will show the correct time for your timezone.
