Editors and IDEs
================

This section contains topics related to code editing tools and IDEs that are commonly used with the ArduPilot project.

    Eclipse on Windows <editing-the-code-with-eclipse>
    NotePad++ <editing-the-code-with-notepad>

-  Emacs on Linux, Windows or MacOS, with etags for finding code elements
-  Vim on emacs with ctags

There are a lot of other IDEs available, and many of them are
sufficiently customisable that they can handle something like ArduPilot
nicely. If you have a favourite and have worked out how to make
ArduPilot development a great experience then please consider
contributing a wiki page on how to use it.
