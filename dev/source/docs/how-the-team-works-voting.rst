- fill in the form title both in the main view and on the top left of the page
- In the description we normally add the following line:

"As this is a non-technical proposal, no reason/s are required, just pick one.  For more details on how this works see here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Pj2ffFvwTnN2HxeTeBXyV7oAq0YONE98E6EJVVpDXCA/edit?usp=sharing"

- The first question should be titled "Your Email", of type "Short answer" and "Required"
- The 2nd question is normally a "Multiple choice" and also "Required"
