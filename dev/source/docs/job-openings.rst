Job Openings in Dev Team
========================

ArduPilot is looking for new team members to fill the following vacant positions.
These are mostly unpaid positions but the successful application can look forward to
becoming a core member of the team with excellent learning opportunities
through extensive access to all the other core developers.

In general the best way to take on these positions is to :ref:`make contact <common-contact-us>` with a member of the dev team (i.e. Tridge, Randy, etc) to express your desire to take on the position then contribute to the code/wiki in line with the responsibilities for the role written below.  If all goes well, after some period of successful contribution you can look forward to officially taking on the title.

.. note:: Currently all positions are filled, but check back on this page every few months if you have an interest, for changes.
