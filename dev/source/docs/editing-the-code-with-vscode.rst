Editing the code with VSCode
============================

VSCode is free and available on all desktop platforms: Windows, Linux, MacOS. VSCode can be downloaded from `here <https://code.visualstudio.com/>`__.

It bundles all tools need to build ArduPilot: C/C++ support, python support, git support, and :ref:`debugging support <debugging-with-gdb-using-vscode>`.

For Windows 10 users, the Remote - WSL extension lets you use the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) as your full-time development environment right from VS Code: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-vscode

For users that might want to collaborate on code using VSCode, `VSCode provides a Live Share utility <https://code.visualstudio.com/learn/collaboration/live-share>`__.
