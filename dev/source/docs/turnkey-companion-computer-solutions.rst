Flying LTE has never been easier


4Gmetry Companion Computer Kit
==============================

.. warning::

   The ArduPilot dev team advise that this product may not be as "turnkey" as indicated below. Community reports indicate that the Kit does not include the LTE module and may also not supply a powering mechanism.  

`4Gmetry <http://4gmetry.voltarobots.com/>`__ (Volta Robots) is a plug&play companion computer kit, based on Odroid XU4 single board computer.

4Gmetry gets telemetry (MavLink) from the Autopilot and streams it over 4G internet to a remote control station. 4Gmetry is fully compatible with Volta OS to remotely manage fleets of robots via a simple high level API. 4Gmetry can be used for computer vision tasks and video/image streaming over internet. 4Gmetry comes ready to connect to your VPN, for safety/security purposes; this also allows you remote console access (e.g. SSH).
