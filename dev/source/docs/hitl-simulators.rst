Hardware In The Loop (HITL) simulation replaces the vehicle and the
environment with a simulator (the Simulator has a high-fidelity aircraft
dynamics model and environment model for wind, turbulence, etc.) The
physical AutoPilot hardware is configured exactly as for flight, and
connects to your computer running the simulator (rather than the
aircraft).

This section contains HITL simulation solutions.

.. note::

   At time of writing X-Plane and Flightgear simulation for ArduPilot
   only support Plane (not Copter or Rover).
