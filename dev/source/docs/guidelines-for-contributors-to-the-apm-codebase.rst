Guidelines for Contributors to the Codebase
===============================================

**How to become a contributor**: Please see \ `this post <http://diydrones.com/profiles/blogs/how-to-contribute-to-the>`__ for
full details. Short version: we are always looking for new team members,
but to avoid disrupting existing work or destabilizing code, we have
processes that bring people in gradually.  In general the process is:

-  Find a specific bug you'd like to fix or a specific feature you'd
   like to add (check out the `issues list <https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot/issues?state=open>`__ if
   to get some ideas).
-  Fix the bug in your own clone and test that it's working
-  Submit the change to the main code base :ref:`via a pull request <submitting-patches-back-to-master>`.

If this fits in well with the project's direction, you will be added to
the list of developers and added to the weekly dev call.
