ArduPilot capabilities can be extended with `ROS <http://www.ros.org/>`__ (aka Robot Operating System).

`ROS <http://www.ros.org/>`__ provides libraries, tools, hardware abstraction, device drivers, visualizers, message-passing, package management, and more to help software developers create robot applications.  In the future we expect ROS will be replaced by `ROS2 <http://design.ros2.org/articles/why_ros2.html>`__

`MAVROS <http://wiki.ros.org/mavros>`__ is a ROS "node" that can convert between ROS topics and `MAVLink messages <https://github.com/ArduPilot/mavlink>`__ allowing ArduPilot vehicles to communicate with ROS.  The `MAVROS code can be found here <https://github.com/mavlink/mavros/tree/master/mavros>`__.

These pages will show you how to:

    :maxdepth: 1

        Install ROS and MAVROS <ros-install>
        Connecting to ArduPilot from ROS <ros-connecting>
        Hector SLAM for non-GPS navigation <ros-slam>
        Google Cartographer SLAM for non-GPS navigation <ros-cartographer-slam>
        Clock/Time syncronisation <ros-timesync>
        Send data from AP to ROS/mavros <ros-data-from-ap>
        ROS with SITL <ros-sitl>
        ROS with SITL in Gazebo <ros-gazebo>
        ROS with distance sensors <ros-distance-sensors>

Prerequisites
=============

- Learn on to use ArduPilot first by following the relevant wiki for `Rover <http://ardupilot.org/rover/index.html>`__, `Copter <http://ardupilot.org/copter/index.html>`__ or `Plane <http://ardupilot.org/plane/index.html>`__. In particular make sure the vehicle works well in Manual and Autonomous modes like Guided and Auto before trying to use ROS.
- Learn how to use ROS by reading the `beginner tutorials <http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials>`__.  In the case of a problem with ROS, it is best to ask on ROS community forums first (or google your error). You will find many other tutorials about ROS like `Emlid <https://docs.emlid.com/navio2/common/dev/ros/>`__.
- Install ROS Kinetic Kame on Ubuntu Linux (16.04). Those are default and LTS version of both ROS and Ubuntu.  ROS does not yet officially support Windows nor MAC.

    VR Robotics has successfully used Rover with ROS for SLAM as demonstrated below.

    We are keen to improve ArduPilot's support of ROS so if you find issues (such as commands that do not seem to be supported), please report them in the `ArduPilot issues list <https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot/issues>`__ with a title that includes "ROS" and we will attempt to resolve them as quickly as possible.
