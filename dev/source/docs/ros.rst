ArduPilot capabilities can be extended with `ROS <http://www.ros.org/>`__ (aka Robot Operating System).

`ROS <http://www.ros.org/>`__ provides libraries, tools, hardware abstraction, device drivers, visualizers, message-passing, package management, and more to help software developers create robot applications.  In the future, we expect ROS will be replaced by `ROS2 <http://design.ros2.org/articles/why_ros2.html>`__

`MAVROS <http://wiki.ros.org/mavros>`__ is a ROS package that can convert between ROS topics and `MAVLink messages <https://github.com/ArduPilot/mavlink>`__ allowing ArduPilot vehicles to communicate with ROS.  The `MAVROS code can be found here <https://github.com/mavlink/mavros/tree/master/mavros>`__.

Prerequisites
=============

- Learn on to use ArduPilot first by following the relevant wiki for `Rover <https://ardupilot.org/rover/index.html>`__, `Copter <https://ardupilot.org/copter/index.html>`__ or `Plane <https://ardupilot.org/plane/index.html>`__. In particular, make sure the vehicle works well in Manual and Autonomous modes like Guided and Auto before trying to use ROS.
- Learn how to use ROS by reading the `beginner tutorials <http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials>`__.  In the case of a problem with ROS, it is best to ask on ROS community forums first (or google your error). You will find many other tutorials about ROS like `Emlid <https://docs.emlid.com/navio2/ros>`__.

    Here is ArduPilot Rover performing path planning around objects using ROS navigation.

    We are keen to improve ArduPilot's support of ROS so if you find issues (such as commands that do not seem to be supported), please report them in the `ArduPilot issues list <https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot/issues>`__ with a title that includes "ROS" and we will attempt to resolve them as quickly as possible.
