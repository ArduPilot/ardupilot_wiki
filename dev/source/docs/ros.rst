ArduPilot can be used with ROS using `Gazebo <http://gazebosim.org/>`__ and `MAVROS <http://wiki.ros.org/mavros>`__.  The best tutorials are these `ErleRobotics Tutorials <http://docs.erlerobotics.com/simulation/vehicles/erle_copter/tutorial_4>`__.

Instructions for using :ref:`Gazebo with ArduPilot are here <using-gazebo-simulator-with-sitl>` and has been `blogged about here <http://diydrones.com/profiles/blogs/705844:BlogPost:2151758>`__.

We are keen to improve ArduPilot's support of ROS so if you find issues (such as commands that do not seem to be supported), please report them in the `ArduPilot issues list <https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot/issues>`__ with a title that includes "ROS" and we will attempt to resolve them as quickly as possible.
