Building the code
=================

The linked articles below explain how to setup your build environment on Linux/Ubuntu, MacOS or Windows and then build ArduPilot with either `waf <https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot/blob/master/BUILD.md>`__ or make.

The instructions below assume that you have already :ref:`installed git <git-install>`, :ref:`forked <git-fork>` and :ref:`cloned <git-clone>` the ArduPilot repo.

Setting up the Build Environment
--------------------------------

- :ref:`Setup the Build Environment on Linux/Ubuntu <building-setup-linux>`
- :ref:`Setup the Build Environment on Windows <building-setup-windows>`
- :ref:`Setup the Build Environment on MacOSX <building-setup-mac>`

Building / Compiling
--------------------

ArduPilot currently supports two build systems, `waf <https://waf.io/>`__ and **make** with waf being the recommended option because it allows building for all boards.
In most cases the build dependencies described for **waf** and **make** are the same, the only part of the instructions that changes is the build commmand. 

**Linux / MacOSX users:**

- Linux and MacOSX users should build with waf as described in `BUILD.md <https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot/blob/master/BUILD.md>`__.

**Windows users:**

Windows users have 3 or 4 options for setting up the build environment. All of the below options will allow building of native (SITL) and Pixhawk-based boards.

- :ref:`Setup the waf Build Environment on Windows using Cygwin <building-setup-windows-cygwin>`
- :ref:`Setup the waf Build Environment on Windows10 using WSL <building-setup-windows10>`
- :ref:`Setup Eclipse on Windows for building with waf <building-setup-windows-eclipse>`

**Board specific instructions:**

- :ref:`Building for Bebop2 on Linux <building-for-bebop-2>`
- :ref:`Building for Bebop on Linux <building-for-bebop-on-linux>`
- :ref:`Building for Beaglebone Black <building-for-beaglebone-black-on-linux>`
