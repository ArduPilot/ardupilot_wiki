Building the code
=================

The linked articles below explain how to setup your build environment on Linux/Ubuntu, MacOS or Windows and then build ArduPilot with `waf <https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot/blob/master/BUILD.md>`__.

The instructions below assume that you have already :ref:`installed git <git-install>`, :ref:`forked <git-fork>` and :ref:`cloned <git-clone>` the ArduPilot repo.

Setting up the Build Environment
--------------------------------

- :ref:`Setup the Build Environment on Linux/Ubuntu <building-setup-linux>`
- :ref:`Setup the Build Environment on Windows <building-setup-windows>`
- :ref:`Setup the Build Environment on MacOSX <building-setup-mac>`


Building / Compiling
--------------------

Once the build environment is set up as above, run the following commmands prior to the initial build. (For Windows users, this is under WSL, as set up above):

- `git submodule init`
- `git submodule update --recursive --init`
- `./Tools/gittools/submodule-sync.sh`
- `./waf configure --board *BoardName*`
- `./waf clean`

`*BoardName*` above is the name of the board, as labeled by its associated folder in
`/ardupiot/libraries/AP_HAL_ChibiOS/hwdef`.

Run the following command, each time you wish to build:
`./waf copter`

(Substitute `plane`, `rover` etc for `copter` as required)
