Ready-to-Fly (RTF) Vehicle Developer Information
================================================

This section is for developer information related to "non-standard" RTF
vehicles based on ArduPilot.

.. note::

   ArduPilot-based UAVs are often very similar from a developer
   perspective; developers upload standard firmware direct to the flight
   controller using Mission Planner (or other GCS software). This section
   is for vehicles that use a non-standard approach, including modified
   source, different approaches for uploading firmware, support for
   companion computers, etc.
