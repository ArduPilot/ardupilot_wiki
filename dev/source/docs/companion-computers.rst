Companion Computers
===================

Companion Computers can be used to interface and communicate with
ArduPilot on a flight controller using the MAVLink protocol.  By doing
this your companion computer gets all the MAVLink data produced by the
autopilot (including GPS data) and can use it to make intelligent
decisions during flight. For example, "take a photo when the vehicle is
at these GPS co-ordinates", gather and pre-process information from advanced
sensors or actuate lights, auxiliary servos or any other interfaces.
