Building ArduPilot for APM2.x on Linux with Make
================================================

Quick start
===========

For Ubuntu, follow these steps to build the code. For other
distributions, see the advanced instructions below.

Setup
-----

Install git:

::

    sudo apt-get -qq -y install git

Clone the source:

::

    git clone https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot.git
    cd ardupilot
    git submodule update --init --recursive

Run the install-prereqs-ubuntu.sh script:

::

    ardupilot/Tools/scripts/install-prereqs-ubuntu.sh -y

Reload the path (log-out and log-in to make permanent):

::

    . ~/.profile

Build
-----

Build for Copter:

::

    cd ardupilot/ArduCopter
    make

Build for Plane:

::

    cd ardupilot/ArduPlane
    make

Build for Rover:

::

    cd ardupilot/APMrover2
    make

Build for Antenna Tracker:

::

    cd ardupilot/AntennaTracker
    make

Advanced
========

To build the ardupilot firmware on Linux, you will need a cross-compiler
for the type of board you are building for. If you are using a debian
based distribution such as Ubuntu then the following should get you the
core packages you will need:

::

    sudo apt-get install gcc-avr avrdude avr-libc binutils-avr

You will also need some extra tools to use the SITL system and
additional development tools

::

    sudo apt-get install python-serial python-wxgtk2.8 python-matplotlib python-opencv python-pexpect python-scipy

Once installed, you can build by changing directory to the vehicle type
you want to build for, and running 'make' with the target you want. Look
in mk/targets.mk for a list of build targets.

Ubuntu Linux
------------

The following packages are required to build ardupilot for the APM1/APM2
(Arduino) platform in Ubuntu:

::

    gawk make git arduino-core g++

To build ardupilot for the PX4 platform, you'll first need to install
the PX4 toolchain and download the PX4 source code.

The easiest way to install all these prerequisites is to run the **ardupilot/Tools/scripts/install-prereqs-ubuntu.sh** script, which will install all the required packages and download all the required software.

Building using make
-------------------

1. For Copter and AntennaTracker you'll need to run ``make configure``
from a sketch directory (ArduCopter or AntennaTracker) before you build
the project for the first time. This will create a **config.mk** file at
the top level of the repository. You can set some defaults in
**config.mk**

2. In the sketch directory, type ``make`` to build for APM2.
Alternatively, ``make apm1`` will build for the APM1 and \`make px4\`
will build for the Pixhawk. The binaries will generated in
\`/tmp/\ *sketchname*.build\`.

3. Type \`make upload\` to upload. You may need to set the correct
default serial port in your \`config.mk\`.
