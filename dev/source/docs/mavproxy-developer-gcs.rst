MAVProxy Developer GCS
======================

:ref:`MAVProxy <mavproxy:home>` is a powerful
command-line based "developer" ground station software that complements
your favorite GUI ground station, such as *Mission Planner*, *APM
Planner 2* etc. It has a number of key features, including the ability
to forward the messages from your UAV over the network via UDP to
multiple other ground station software on other devices.

MAVProxy is commonly used by developers (especially with SITL) :ref:`for testing new builds <using-sitl-for-ardupilot-testing>`.

The :ref:`MAVProxy Documentation<mavproxy:home>` contains detailed
information on how to use the tool.
