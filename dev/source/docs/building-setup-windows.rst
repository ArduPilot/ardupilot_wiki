#. Install the Pixhawk Toolchain by downloading and running the `pixhawk_toolchain_installer_latest.exe <http://firmware.ardupilot.org/Tools/PX4-tools/pixhawk_toolchain_installer_latest.exe>`__

#. If you wish to use Eclipse for editing and building, follow :ref:`these instructions <editing-the-code-with-eclipse>`

#. To run MAVProxy locally on Windows follow the `MAVProxy's install instructions for Windows <https://ardupilot.github.io/MAVProxy/html/getting_started/download_and_installation.html#windows>`__

Next you will probably want to :ref:`build for Pixhawk on Windows with Make <building-px4-with-make>`.
