ArduPilot Unit Tests
====================

ArduPilot's Unit Test suite allows for the creation of repeatable tests
which help prevent regressions in ArduPilot's internal functions.  It is based
on Google's `GTest Framework <https://github.com/google/googletest>`__.

Using ArduPilot's Unit Tests can:

   - make your development process more efficient by reducing time spent repeatedly running the same tests to force the same inputs to a function time and again
   - allow you to repeatedly replicate bad behaviour in an ArduPilot function, and possibly ship that test to a developer capable of fixing the issue ("test-driven-development")
   - reduce the chances of a regression in an ArduPilot function's behaviour by locking in tests for that function's behaviour

Overview
========

The Unit test suite is run on ArduPilot's autotest server on most
commits to the master branch, but can be run locally to vet software
changes.  Adding tests is straight-forward and encouraged to prove a
function's correctness after a change.


Running Unit Tests
==================

The Unit Tests require an environment in which the ArduPilot executables can be compiled.  The easiest way to obtain this is to create a SITL testing environment.  Use the SITL instructions (:ref:`SITL <using-sitl-for-ardupilot-testing>`) to obtain a valid environment.  It is suggested the ArduPilot Vagrant virtual machine configuration files be used to obtain a working environment.

Invocation
----------

.. note::

   These tests work well under Linux.  Operation under different environments is unknown.

The unit tests are compiled using the `waf` build tool:

::

    pbarker@bluebottle:~/rc/ardupilot(master)$ ./waf configure --board=linux --debug
    Setting top to                           : /home/pbarker/rc/ardupilot 
    Setting out to                           : /home/pbarker/rc/ardupilot/build 
    Autoconfiguration                        : enabled 
    .
    .
    .
    Scripting runtime checks                       : enabled 
    Checking for program 'rsync'                   : /usr/bin/rsync 
    'configure' finished successfully (1.085s)

    Build commands will be stored in build/linux/compile_commands.json
    'tests' finished successfully (2.249s)

You can then simply run the test from the build directory:

Using with GDB
..............

The tests can be run under GDB to trace problems:


::

    pbarker@bluebottle:~/rc/ardupilot(master)$ gdb --quiet --args ./build/linux/tests/test_vector2
    Reading symbols from ./build/linux/tests/test_vector2...done.

Using with Valgrind
...................

The tests can be run under Valgrind's memcheck too to trace memory problems:

Unit Tests Structure
====================

A directory in the ArduPilot source tree can contain a `wscript` file designating it as containing unit tests.

Each .cpp file in that directory is then considered a valid test, and will be included in the tests compiled when `waf` is invoked for the `tests` target.

Tests are present in the following directories at time if writing:
::

    libraries/AP_Common/tests
    libraries/AP_Math/tests
    libraries/AP_ADSB/tests
    libraries/AP_GPS/tests
    libraries/AP_HAL/tests
    libraries/AP_HAL/utility/tests
    libraries/AP_HAL_Linux/tests

Adding a Unit Test
==================

Generally copying an existing file aside and using it as the basis of your new tests is the way forward.  See the GTest framework documentation for more information.
