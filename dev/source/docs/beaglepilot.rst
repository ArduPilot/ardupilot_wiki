The BeaglePilot Project aims to create the first Linux-based autopilot
for flying robots using the BeagleBone and the BeagleBone Black as the
"hardware blueprint".

For this purpose the project will focus on integrating ArduPilot (most
popular autopilot) in the BeagleBone (Black). The main tasks performed
will be userspace drivers development, the Robot Operative System
Integration (ROS), web IDE exploration and security assessment.

Getting ArduPilot in the BeagleBone Black
=========================================

Refer to the instructions provided in the article :ref:`Building (ardupilot) for BeagleBone Black on Linux <building-for-beaglebone-black-on-linux>`.

Platforms
=========

For now BeaglePilot is still in development phase being tested in the
following devices:

-  BeagleBone Black + PixHawk Fire Cape
-  `Erle Robot <https://erlerobotics.com>`__
