Using Linux Trace Toolkit ng (LTTng) to Create Realtime ArduPilot Traces
========================================================================

This article explains how to use `LTTng <https://lttng.org>`__ for
creating runtime traces for ArduPilot running on Linux boards (only).

Overview
========

Tracing is a technique used to record the real-time behaviour of a
software in memory and analyze the execution of the code off-line. It
can be very useful to understand the interaction between threads,
processes, the duration of certain events and the sequencing of some
operations.

*LTTng* is a Linux tool that can be used to trace either a userspace
application, or the Linux kernel itself. It produces trace files that
can be analyzed later, mostly off-board. Lttng's implementation in ArduPilot
uses userspace tracing but you can at the same time monitor what's going
on inside the kernel, provided the kernel has tracepoints enabled (in
its config).

*LTTng* has been integrated using the
`Perf_Lttng <https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot/blob/master/libraries/AP_HAL_Linux/Perf_Lttng.cpp>`__
class, which handles 3 operations: ``Begin``, ``End``, ``Count``. You
add tracing to your code by calling the performance utility methods in
`Perf.cpp <https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot/blob/master/libraries/AP_HAL_Linux/Perf.cpp>`__.

Monitoring APM with LTTng
=========================

In order to monitor ArduPilot with *LTTng*, the first thing to do is to install LTTng
on your board. The *LTTng* documentation explains how to install it on your Linux
distribution `here <https://lttng.org/docs/#doc-installing-lttng>`__. If
there is no official package for your Linux distribution, you can also
build it from the sources as explained
`here <http://lttng.org/download/#build-from-source>`__

.. note::

   You can't build statically with *LTTng* enabled because it calls
   dlopen. On bebop I had to build the whole system with armhf
   toolchain, which is not the one used by default.

Putting trace events inside the code
------------------------------------

In order to trace ArduPilot, you call the following performance utility
methods:

::

    hal.util->perf_begin(my_perf);

::

    hal.util->perf_end(my_perf);

Before calling these functions, ``my_perf`` needs to be allocated

::

    AP_HAL::Util::perf_counter_t my_perf = hal.util->perf_alloc(AP_HAL::Util::PC_ELAPSED, "my_perf");

An example of adding multiple perf events can be seen in `this patch <https://github.com/jberaud/ardupilot/commit/4bd763d58a6b529630629ad581de198f9d6e6731>`__.

Trace capture
-------------

Enable trace events in ArduPilot
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you have the modified version of ArduPilot launched on your board
and *LTTng* tools installed, you can check that ArduPilot *LTTng* events
are available on your board's console terminal using the following
command:

.. code:: bash

    lttng list --userspace

This should output a list of events including:

::

    ardupilot:count (loglevel: TRACE_DEBUG_LINE (13)) (type: tracepoint)
    ardupilot:end (loglevel: TRACE_DEBUG_LINE (13)) (type: tracepoint)
    ardupilot:begin (loglevel: TRACE_DEBUG_LINE (13)) (type: tracepoint)

.. tip::

   Refer to the `LTTng documentation <https://lttng.org/docs/#doc-tracing-the-linux-kernel>`__
   for information on how to list kernel events.

Capturing a trace session
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A trace session can be started, stopped, re-started and destroyed.

Destroying a trace session doesn't delete the traces from permanent
storage but means that you have to restart a new session if you want to
continue capturing.

#. Create session:

   ::

       lttng create -o my_trace_directory

#. Enable ArduPilot events:

   ::

       lttng enable-event --userspace ardupilot:count
       lttng enable-event --userspace ardupilot:end
       lttng enable-event --userspace ardupilot:begin

   To enable kernel events, see `these instructions <https://lttng.org/docs/#doc-tracing-the-linux-kernel>`__.

#. Start capturing:

   ::

       lttng start

#. To stop capturing:

   ::

       lttng stop

#. If you have *babeltrace* installed on board, you can view the result
   in text:

   ::

       lttng view

#. Restart or destroy your session:

   ::

       lttng destroy

Analyzing the trace
===================

In order to analyze your trace, first copy the trace directory you
indicated at session creation to your computer.

Babeltrace
----------

You can analyze the trace using *babeltrace*. This is a command line
tool that is able to translate the trace into text format:

::

    babeltrace my_trace_directory

The result is a series of events with the according timestamps and the
number of the CPU they have been running on.

To go further with that, you can use `babeltrace's python bindings <http://diamon.org/babeltrace/docs/python/>`__ to write a
python program analyzing the trace you have captured.

Trace compass
-------------

`Trace compass <https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/tools.tracecompass>`__ is
an Eclipse plugin that can read *LTTng* traces and display them in a UI
that is adapted to some analyzes.

Lttng2lxt
---------

Trace compass is very powerful but up to now, I haven't been able to
analyze userspace traces in a convenient way.

*Lttng2lxt* is an open source tool written by Ivan Djelic from Parrot.
It is a very simple command line tool that generate waveforms readable
by `gtkwave <http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/>`__. I have added support
for ArduPilot events to *lttng2lxt*.

In order to use it, get the sources from my github repository:

::

    git clone https://github.com/jberaud/lttng2lxt

You will have to install \ *libbabeltrace-ctf-dev*
and \ *libbabeltrace*. On Debian or Ubuntu do this with the following
command:

::

    sudo apt-get install libbabeltrace-ctf-dev libbabeltrace

Compile it:

::

    sudo make install

Use it to generate a *gtkwave* waveform file:

::

    lttng2lxt my_trace_directory

This will produce a file called **my_trace_directory.lxt**.

Analyzing your trace using gtkwave
----------------------------------

First install *gtkwave*. On Debian or Ubuntu you can do this with the
command:

::

    sudo apt-get install gtkwave

Then open your trace using *gtkwave*:

::

    gtkwave -A my_trace_directory.lxt

Use the **Zoom fit** button |zoom_fit|.

The result should look like this:

.. image:: ../images/after_zoom_fit.png
    :target: ../_images/after_zoom_fit.png

You can then zoom in or out and see the exact execution sequence, with
the associated timings

.. image:: ../images/timings.png
    :target: ../_images/timings.png

You can therefore measure the duration of an event with the cursors (use
the mouse middle button to set the first cursor)

.. |zoom_fit| image:: ../images/zoom_fit.png
    :target: ../_images/zoom_fit.png
