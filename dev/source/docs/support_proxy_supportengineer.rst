Connecting as a Support Engineer
================================

.. note:: this page is for the use of ArduPilot support engineers. If you are a Partner or user, see :ref:`support_proxy` for instructions.


If you are a support engineer you will have been given 3 pieces of
information:

 - the port number that you will connect on
 - the port number that your users will connect on
 - an initial randomly generated MAVLink2 signing pass phrase

.. note::

   Your computers system clock must be accurate for the proxy to
   work. If it is off by more than one minute then signing may fail.

To setup your support proxy port for MissionPlanner you need to use
the Advanced->Mavlink Signing tool:

.. image:: ../images/MissionPlanner_mavlink_signing1.jpg
    :target: ../_images/MissionPlanner_mavlink_signing1.jpg

In that tool you need to create a signing key using the pass phrase
you have been given:

.. image:: ../images/MissionPlanner_mavlink_signing2.jpg
    :target: ../_images/MissionPlanner_mavlink_signing2.jpg

Use the "Add" button to add the key, and the "Save" button to save it.

Once the signing key is setup you can start to accept connections from
users. You should direct your users to the instructions at the top of
this page.

To connect to your side of the proxy use the UDPCI connection method
in MissionPlanner:

.. image:: ../images/MissionPlanner_connect_UDPCI.jpg
    :target: ../_images/MissionPlanner_connect_UDPCI.jpg

After pressing connect choose "support.ardupilot.org" as the host:

.. image:: ../images/MissionPlanner_connect_host.jpg
    :target: ../_images/MissionPlanner_connect_host.jpg

and your support engineer port number as the port:

.. image:: ../images/MissionPlanner_connect_port.jpg
    :target: ../_images/MissionPlanner_connect_port.jpg

To change the pass phrase you use for your connection you can use
create and save a new key in the MAVLink Signing tool then select it
and press the "Use" button:

.. image:: ../images/MissionPlanner_signing_use.jpg
    :target: ../_images/MissionPlanner_signing_use.jpg

pressing "Use" will update the signing key for your support ID.
