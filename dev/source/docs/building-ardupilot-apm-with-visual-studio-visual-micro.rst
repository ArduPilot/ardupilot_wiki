Building ArduPilot with Atmel Studio or Visual Studio &amp; Visual Micro
========================================================================

This tutorial provides instructions for how to set up and build AMP
using Atmel Studio 6.2 or Microsoft Visual Studio with the `Visual Micro <http://www.visualmicro.com/>`__ plugin.

Introduction
============

Want a robust development environment for the APM code?  Try out Atmel
Studio 6.2 or Microsoft Visual Studio with the \ `Visual Micro <http://www.visualmicro.com/>`__ plugin. You can edit, build and
upload the APM code using these tools. The builds and uploads are the
same as with the ArduPilot Ardunio builds.

**Overview:** Atmel Studio or Microsoft Visual Studio provides a robust
Integrated Development Environment (IDE). However, the ArduPilot code is
set up to use the special ArduPilot Arduino IDE and that structure does
not work in those environments without some plugin to setup the correct
structure and provide the up-load tools. Finding the source code for the
various functions and classes is difficult using Arduino - sometimes
requiring a manual search through multiple folders and files to find the
actual source code for one function or class used in the main code setup
or loop.

**Solution:** Visual Micro solves most of these problems. Visual Micro
is a plugin to Atmel Studio or Visual Studio that adds the following
features:

-  Compatibility with the Arduino Code structure, libraries, file naming
   and sketches - with the robust studio IDE.
-  Uploading Arduino sketches to any of the Arduino boards - and, to the
   APM boards.
-  All the files are shown in the solution panel, making it easy to
   open, browse or edit any file.
-  Take a look at the \ `Visual Micro <http://www.visualmicro.com/>`__ website for all the details.
-  Visual Micro has a debug feature when used with standard Arduino
   sketches but the APM code has removed or modified much of the
   standard Arduino features like Serial.print() and the hardware Serial
   features. The Visual Micro debugger does not work with APM. However,
   do not let that dissuade you from trying the Atmel Studio or Visual
   Studio IDE.

Here you will find a step by step process to set up Atmel Studio or
Visual Studio to browse, edit, build and upload the APM code.  Special
thanks to Tim Leek at Visual Micro for developing this great plugin and
for his help in creating this document.

Setup
=====

Even if you are not a current user of Atmel Studio or Visual Studio Pro,
but have used Arduino IDE to build the APM code, then this process will
get you started. Links to other wiki pages are provided where
appropriate for more detail.  No detail is included for Visual Studio or
Atmel Studio features. You will need to learn that on your own.

The  `Visual Micro <http://www.visualmicro.com/>`__ website explains
how to install Visual Micro for Arduino and how to set up Atmel Studio
or Visual Studio to work with Arduino sketches and boards. What is not
clearly covered is how to add support for the APM boards. Once that
information is clear, the set up is quite simple. Here is a summary of
the key steps required:

-  Assumptions:

   -  The special ArduPilot Arduino must be installed and tested to
      build and upload the code. The complete details
      are :ref:`here <building-ardupilot-with-arduino-windows>`. For
      this example it is assumed that the installation is
      at C:\\ArduPilot-Arduino-1.0.3-windows.
   -  You need `Atmel Studio 6.2 <http://www.atmel.com/tools/ATMELSTUDIO.aspx>`__ (free) or a
      licensed full version of  Visual Studio Pro 2008, 2010 or 2012
      installed. Visual Micro does not work with the free Express
      versions of Visual Studio.  Visual Studio 2008 is used in this
      example.
   -  You need the ArduPilot source code. For this tutorial the APM
      source code is assumed to be located
      in C:\\Users\\Public\\Documents\\ardupilot-Copter-3.1.3.

      Get the latest released code zip files "Plane x.x.x"
      `here <http://firmware.ardupilot.org/>`__ or use :ref:`Git Hub <where-to-get-the-code>` to
      create a clone of the current code. If you want a specific release
      version go to the `diydrones/ardupilot <https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot>`__ repository,
      select the desired ardupilot branch, then click download zip.

-  Download and install Visual Micro from the \ `Visual Micro <http://www.visualmicro.com/>`__ website and compete the
   `setup <http://www.visualmicro.com/post/2011/10/04/How-to-test-a-new-installation-of-Arduino-for-Visual-Studio.aspx>`__.
   Instructions are at the site.
-  Test Visual Micro for Arduino using
   these `instructions <http://www.visualmicro.com/post/2011/10/04/How-to-test-a-new-installation-of-Arduino-for-Visual-Studio.aspx>`__.
   Get it working before you proceed.
-  Download and install the APM board information.  This is a key
   requirement to build and upload the APM code.

   -  Go to the \ `Apm - Installation Guide <http://www.visualmicro.com/post/2013/05/02/APM-Installation-Guide.aspx>`__ on
      the Visual Micro Forum. Read the post, then download the
      `boards.txt file <http://www.visualmicro.com/downloads/APM_Sketchbook_Hardware.zip>`__.

   -  Put the file  "boards.txt" into a folder "APM" within the folder
      "Arduino/hardware".  Regardless of where you Arduino IDE is
      located your Arduino folder (in this case C:\\ArduPilot-Arduino-1.0.3-windows) should look like
      this:
      
      .. image:: ../images/VisualMicroHardware.jpg
          :target: ../_images/VisualMicroHardware.jpg
    
   -  Run Atmel Studio or Visual Studio and set up for APM as follows:
       (APM2 is used in this example.)

      -  Tools>>Visual Micro>>Boards:  Select  Arduino Mega 2560 HAL
         (Apm 2)
      -  Tools>>Options>>Visual Micro: On right of window, select
         Applications & Locations>>Application Ide Locations>>Click to
         configure Ide locations:  In the dialog window:

         -  Select Arduino to "1.0.x: in the drop down text box.
         -  Set the ide folder location to
            C:\\ArduPilot-Arduino-1.0.3-windows  (or the location of
            your Arduino IDE).
         -  Set the sketchbook location
            to C:\\Users\\Public\\Documents\\ardupilot-Copter-3.1.3  (or
            the location of your ArduPilot code).
         -  Note: This is the folder containing folders APMover2,
            Copter, Plane, docs, FollowMe, libraries, mk and Tools.

            Here is how the setup should look for this
            tutorial:
            
            .. image:: ../images/VisualMicroSetup.jpg
                :target: ../_images/VisualMicroSetup.jpg


Open the arducopter.pde sketch:  File>>Open>>Sketch Project:

Select Copter\\arducopter.pde  (or arducopter.pde file in you code
folder.)

Build the code:  Build>>Clean Solution then Build>>Build Solution.  The
code should build without error. Depending on what source code your are
using, you may get the message "Sketch too big ...". You can reduce the
size by un-commenting some of the compile options in APM_Config.h.

**Important:** Each time you change a #define statement (or comment one
or un-comment one) you must do Build>>Clean Solution followed by
Build>>Rebuild Solution.  Details are below in the Hints and Notes
section.

Uploading the code
==================

After your code builds without errors you can upload the firmware to the
APM.

-  First do this:

   Tools>>Options>>Visual Micro -Micro Debug - Advanced: Set Automatic
   debugging to False. Then F5 will upload without debugging - saving
   the need to press CTRL with F5.
   
-  Connect your APM via the USB cable.
-  Tools>>Visual Micro>>Serial Port. Set to the USB port detected for
   your APM. If the USB port is not detected, follow the Arduino
   installation instructions for adding the proper drivers.  If the
   Arduino IDE works, then Visual Studio / Visual Micro should also
   work.
-  To upload to the APM board, just press F5.

The build, and upload to the APM was flight tested by the author for the
code release 3.1.3. The flight modes stabilize, altitude hold and loiter
were all tested and behaved the same as upload of the same revision
using Mission Planner.  However, be aware that building your own upload
from the source can result in unexpected results. You must configure all
the options defines and other code correctly. Be careful, have fun and
enjoy Visual Studio with Visual Micro.

Hints and Notes
===============

This procedure was tested to build and upload to the APM on the authors
PC. There are other ways to configure Arduino, Atmel Studio, Visual
Studio, and Visual Micro. Those methods are left to the reader. For
instance, you can install the ArduPilot Arduino IDE in any location, not
just in the Programs area. It is suggested to use this process first to
verify everything works.

**Ways to reduce the size of Copter so it will build:** In Visual Studio
or Atmel Studio solution panel (where the source files are listed), open
the file Copter/Header Files/APM_Config.h and un-comment some of the
#Define XXX DISABLED lines to save some space. I.E. disable  MOUNT,
OPTFLOW, CAMERA,CONFIG_SONAR and/or PARACHUTE as appropriate for your
APM.  Each time you change a define you must do Build>>Clean Solution
followed by Build>>Rebuild Solution.

**Errors building from fresh source clone:**  The first time you set the
application location (for instance after getting a fresh clone of the
source) or change the IDE you are using, you may get build errors even
though you have selected the correct Arduino board.  To get an error
free build, just re-select the correct board. See Multiple installs of
Arduino below for one reason this may occur.

**Fast compile vs changing defines:**  Visual Micro has a default option
for fast compiles. This is setup as the default. The IDE checks for
changes to files and if there are no changes, does not recompile
unchanged files.  This really great feature has a side effect when
define statements are changed because they effect other files but do not
specifically change the text (code) thus files effected by defines will
not be recompiled causing a real mess.  There are two ways to avoid this
issue:

-  Each and every time you change a define or un-comment a define or
   comment a define do this:

   -  Build>>Clean>>Solution (That will clean out the pre-compiled cache)
   -  Build>>Rebuild
   -  All following builds (assuming no changes to defines) can be the
      really fast version Build>>Build Solution

-  Or, if you like to wait a long time for each compile you can change
   the Visual Micro options

   -  Tools>>Options.   Select Visual Micro. scroll down to Compiler
      Optimisation. Hey, in UK they spell it that way.
   -  Set Core Modified and Library Modified to False

Multiple installs of Arduino:  It is important to note that Arduino has
only one location where the parameters are stored -
in C:\\Users\\....\\AppData\\Roaming\\Arduino\\preferences.txt.  Any
time you start any installation of Arduino - a standard version, the
Arudpilot Arduino version or even changing settings in Visual Micro -
that file may get changed.  So, it is very important to check all the
settings in the IDE you are using each time you change the IDE - to
avoid having the preferences set to that of the last IDE you used.

**Referencing a standard Arduino in Visual Micro:** 
Normally, Visual Micro is setup to reference a standard installation of Arduino instead
of the special Arudpilot Ardunio for the HAL versions of APM.  You can
configure Visual Studio or Atmel Studio to reference a standard
installation and it may build and upload the APM code but that upload
will not work.  The build size is different and it does not connect to
Mission Planner. It is strongly suggested you only reference the special
Arudupilot Arduino installation when working with APM code.

**Using Arduino statements and libraries:**  
This is better stated as
not using standard Arduino statements.  The newer HAL versions of
ArduPilot for the APM boards removed most, if not all, of the standard
Arduino statements and libraries.  You can not just add an
analogRead(sensorPin) statement for instance. So, do not be frustrated
if you try to use the standard Arduino language reference to edit the
APM code - it will mostly not work. There are equivalent calls and
statements for the APM but you will have to search for examples in the
code.

**Building Older Versions of ArduPilot:**  
If you are still working with
version 2.9.1b or possibly older versions prior to HAL, you can take
advantage of the Atmel Studio or Visual Studio and Visual Micro IDE.

You just need to do the following:

-  Download the version of `ArduPilot Arduino that supports the 2.x.x revisions <https://code.google.com/p/ardupilot-mega/downloads/detail?name=ArduPilot-Arduino-1.0.3-windows.zip&can=2&q=>`__.
   Don't confuse this with the current version. They have the same name
   but are different.
-  Install the ArduPilot Arduino in a separate folder, and add the
   apm/boards.txt file into the hardware folder - like the above
   instructions.
-  In Atmel (or Visual) Studio, in Tools>>Options>>Visual Micro, set the
   Applications and Arduino locations to reference the ArduPilot Arduino
   that supports the 2.x.x revisions, and to the folder containing the
   2.x.x source code. You can get the 2.9.1b code
   at the `diydrones/ardupilot <https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot>`__ repository,
   select the desired ardupilot branch, then click download zip.
-  Set Tools>>Visual Micro>>Boards to APM Arduino Mega 2560.
