RoadMap for 2020/2021
=====================

       :width: 40%

This roadmap shows the direction of the ArduPilot team in 2020 and beyond.  The purpose of this roadmap
is not to guarantee exactly when features will be added but instead to help the team, `Partners <https://ardupilot.org/about/Partners>`__
and independent developers to spot areas for cooperation.  There will also undoubtedly be developments that are not on this list.

The main point of contact for each area is provided so that those looking to join in or sponsor the development
know who to contact (see :ref:`Contact Us <common-contact-us>` for a list of ways to contact the devs).
