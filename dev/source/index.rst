Welcome to the ArduPilot Development Site

.. tip::

    The ArduPilot Developer Ecosystem is Evolving! 
    `Find out more here â€¦ <http://diydrones.com/profiles/blogs/a-new-chapter-in-ardupilot-development>`__


:ref:`ArduPilot/APM <ardupilot:home>` is a open source autopilot
system supporting multi-copters, traditional helicopters, fixed wing
aircraft and rovers. The source code is developed by a `large community of enthusiasts <http://ardupilot.org>`__. 
New developers are always welcome! The best way to start is by joining the 
`Developer Team Forum <http://discuss.ardupilot.org/c/development-team>`__, which
is open to all and chock-full of daily development goodness. Lurk for a
while to get a feel for it, then participate!

Why the name?
=============

The 'Ardu' part of the ArduPilot name comes from Arduino. The original
APM1 autopilot board was based around the
`Arduino <http://www.arduino.cc/>`__ development environment. We've
since outgrown the Arduino environment and no longer use the Arduino
runtime libraries, although we do still support building the ArduPilot
for the AVR based APM1 and APM2 boards using a slightly modified version
of the Arduino integrated development environment. A timeline history of
ArduPilot can be found :ref:`here <history-of-ardupilot>`.


Supported boards
================

:ref:`Supported AutoPilot Controller Boards <supported-autopilot-controller-boards>` provides an overview
and key links for all the supported controller boards, including
`Pixhawk <https://store.3drobotics.com/products/3dr-pixhawk>`__, `Arsov AUAV-X2 <http://www.auav.co/product-p/auavx2.htm>`__,
`Erle-Brain <http://erlerobotics.com/docs/Intro.html>`__,
`NAVIO+ <http://www.emlid.com/>`__ etc.

The ArduPilot/APM source code is written on top of
the `AP-HAL <https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot/tree/master/libraries/AP_HAL>`__
hardware abstraction layer, making it possible to port the code to a
wide range of autopilot boards. See this `blog post <http://diydrones.com/profiles/blogs/lots-of-changes-to-apm-development>`__
for more information on the move to AP-HAL.

Development languages and tools
===============================

The main flight code for ArduPilot is written in C++. Support tools are
written in a variety of languages, most commonly in python. Currently
the main vehicle code is written as '.pde' files, which come from the
Arduino build system. The pde files are preprocessed into a .cpp file as
part of the build. The include statements in the pde files also provide
implied build rules for what libraries to include and link to.
