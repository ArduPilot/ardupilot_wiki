======================================

This article explains how to calibrate your autopilot's accelerometer to
work with your vehicle configuration. For other calibration tasks see
:ref:`Autopilot calibration <autopilot-calibration>`.

1 Prerequisites
===============

Before preforming setup, ensure that:

-  The vehicle is completely built to flight condition.
-  :ref:`Firmware has been loaded onto the autopilot. <install-firmware>`
-  :ref:`Autopilot is connected to APM Planner. <connect-autopilot>`

2 Accelerometer Calibration
