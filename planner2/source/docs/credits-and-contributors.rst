APM Planner 2.0 is the next generation of ground control station. It is
the offspring of :ref:`Mission Planner <planner:home>` and
`QGround Control <http://qgroundcontrol.org/>`__, combining the simple
user interface of Mission Planner and cross platform capability of
QGround Control.

We offer a special thanks to `Michael Oborne <https://diydrones.com/profiles/profile/show?id=Michaelo&>`__ and his team at
:ref:`Mission Planner <planner:home>` and `Lorenz Meier <https://diydrones.com/profiles/profile/show?id=LorenzMeier&>`__ and the team at
`QGround Control <http://qgroundcontrol.org/credits>`__.

APM Planner 2.0 is written in `Qt <http://www.qt.io/developers/>`__, a
cross platform development environment that allows it to run on Windows,
Mac, and Linux.

APM Planner is currently lead by:

-  Bill Bonney  (`GitHub <https://github.com/billbonney>`__  `DiyDrones <https://diydrones.com/profiles/profile/show?id=BillBonney&>`__)
