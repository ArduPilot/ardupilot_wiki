Install Packages
================

Open a terminal window and go to the location where you downloaded the
.deb file from step 2 and type the following command:

::

    sudo dpkg -i apm_planner*.deb

The installation will likely fail because of missing dependencies. 
These dependencies can be installed with this command:

Then retry the apmplanner installation again:

::

    sudo dpkg -i apm_planner*.deb

=========================
Open Terminal windows and run

    apmplanner2

Or use the link create in your launcher

Common problems
===============

If you find the APM Planner 2 is unable to connect to the APM2/Pixhawk,
it may be because of the modemmanager package.  Uninstall this package
by entering the following command into a terminal window:

::

    sudo apt-get --purge remove modemmanager
