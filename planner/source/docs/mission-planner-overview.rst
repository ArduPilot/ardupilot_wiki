Mission Planner is a ground control station for Plane, Copter and Rover.
It is compatible with Windows only. Mission Planner can be used as a
configuration utility or as a dynamic control supplement for your
autonomous vehicle. Here are just a few things you can do with Mission
Planner:

-  Load the :ref:`firmware <common-glossary>` (the software) into the
   autopilot board (i.e. Pixhawk series) that controls your vehicle.
-  Setup, configure, and tune your vehicle for optimum performance.
-  Plan, save and load autonomous missions into you autopilot with
   simple point-and-click way-point entry on Google or other maps.
-  Download and analyze mission logs created by your autopilot.
-  Interface with a PC flight simulator to create a full
   hardware-in-the-loop UAV simulator.
-  With appropriate telemetry hardware you can:

   -  Monitor your vehicle's status while in operation.
   -  Record telemetry logs which contain much more information the the
      on-board autopilot logs.
   -  View and analyze the telemetry logs.
   -  Operate your vehicle in FPV (first person view)

All of these and many more features are covered here.

Support
=======

**The Help Screen:**

Clicking the Help icon at the top of the Mission Planner interface will
open a screen with general information about help with Mission Planner.
The "Check for Updates" button will check for available updates to
Mission Planner manually. Mission Planner automatically checks for
updates upon start up and notifies you if an update is available. Please
always run the most current version of Mission Planner, although it is
not necessary to check for updates more often than upon start up. 

The "Check for BETA Updates" button will install the current development version of Mission Planner. This contains all the latest features and updates, but also might have bugs, since it does not have extensive community testing.

At the bottom of the HELP screen is the check box "Show Console Window (restart)" , which enables the console window during Mission Planner operation.  That window shows Mission Planner
activity and is primarily for diagnostic purposes.  It sometimes shows
some interesting information. A restart of Mission Planner is required
for the option to take effect.

Navigating the Documentation
============================

Use the table of contents at the top of each page to navigate the
Mission Planner Manual - and the contents of the vehicle specific areas.

This section of our website contains information on how to use Mission
Planner as a "general" application. However, some of the pages will also
have some vehicle specific information. Those pages will also be
contained in the specific vehicle's section of the website. Information
that is primarily specific to a particular vehicle will only be located
in that vehicles section so, if you cannot find information here, try
the section of the website for the vehicle you are using.
