Mission Planner - Proposed Table Of Contents (TOC)
==================================================

Revision date:  11/24/2013

This proposal suggests what may be a good structure for the Mission
Planner wiki Table of Contents and perhaps for the Main website
"Instructions" menu for those items that are "instructions".

suggestions, requests or notify the group you have changed this plan.

Legend for the 'Proposed' TOC for Mission Planner
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

-  Each bullet, text color or style indicates the proposed location in
   the order of the TOC and the indentation in the TOC.
-  (page url) A Link to find the wiki page to be used. (TBD) indicates
   the page is not yet created.

Creating and Naming new pages

If you create a new page in the Planner wiki, consider these
suggestions:

-  The wiki page should have significant content about how the MP works,
   and how to use it.
-  A page with Vehicle Specific content, organized to fulfill BOTH the
   Vehicle specific information AND MP manual content, and is to be used
   in the vehicle wikis should start with the name "common-" so it can
   be automatically copied to the Vehicle wikis.
-  If the new page is not in the proposed TOC, add it above in the right
   place and with the correct indentation.

Other things to consider.

Feel free to work with the group to change this process or this page to
make the effort of organization and contribution easier.

For Editors without privileges to organize the site, menus and TOCs, Use
this as a guideline for inputs and request to change the Organization or
the TOC and the content of the Planner wiki. The 'Proposed' TOC above
thus becomes the combined inputs of the editors. and is a work in
progress for the process of migration of pages to common area, adding
pages to the website's Planner area, and the Mission Planner TOC, Make
requests, suggestions etc
