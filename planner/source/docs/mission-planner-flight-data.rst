Control and Status (Lower Left)
===============================
The Control and Status area of the Flight Data screen is in the lower left-hand portion of Mission Planner. In this area, you can select any of several different tabs. Some tabs provide information (e.g. Status) and other items allow control of the vehicle (e.g. Actions) using the telemetry uplink. (Telemetry radio connection is required)

- Quick:  This allows a quick look at just a few telemetry values in large text.  Double-click to add items. Right-click to change the number of rows/columns and move the tab to a separate window.
- Actions: Use this area to control your Auto Pilot either for testing (using USB and no motor battery) or for controlling your vehicle. You can switch modes, arm/disarm (while on the ground), enable an attached joystick, restart a mission in the air, control a camera mount, etc.
  - The dropdown menus on the left are for (in order from top to bottom) choosing a MAVLink action, choosing a waypoint to set, choosing a mode to set, and choosing the state of the camera mount. The buttons directly to the right of each dropdown send the selected action to the connected vehicle.
  - There are shortcut buttons for Auto, Loiter, and RTL modes
  - Joystick: Allows the user to set up a joystick attached to the ground station
  - Set Home Alt: Set current altitude to zero
  - Restart Mission: Set the current waypoint to the start of the current mission
  - Raw Sensor View: Shows roll, pitch, and yaw angles. Also shows gyro, accelerometer, 8 RC input channels, and 8 servo output channels.
  - Arm/Disarm: Arm and disarm the vehicle.
  - Resume Mission: Change to Auto mode at the previous waypoint.
  - Change Speed: This value is always in m/s and performs a DO_CHANGE_SPEED command
  - Change Alt: This value is in the user-selected altitude units. The default units are meters.
  - Set Loiter Rad: This changes the loiter radius when in Loiter mode in meters.
  - Clear Track: Clears the purple track line shown on the map.
  - Abort Landing: Commands the vehicle-specific abort landing procedure.
- Messages: Messages from the vehicle that can range in importance from informational to critical. Important messages also appear on the HUD.
- Gauges: This shows four popular telemetry gauges. Double click the speed gauge to change the top speed.
- Status: Clicking the Status menu button will display all of the telemetry parameters
- Servos/Relay: This allows the setting of any relay pins or setting/overriding RC values for channels 5 thru 14. (Use servo settings with caution, you could change flight modes)
- :ref:`Telemetry Logs <planner:mission-planner-telemetry-logs>`:  Use this section to view, analyze, convert, and playback telemetry logs that are recorded by Mission Planner. See :ref:`Playing Back Missions with Tlogs <common-recording-and-playing-back-missions>` for specifics on playing back your mission and viewing the mission in the map area.
- Data Flash Logs:  This provides a means to download data flash logs, analyze them, or create KML/gpx files from them. Click Review a Log to open a log file and establish a new window to view/analyze the log. Details :ref:`here <common-downloading-and-analyzing-data-logs-in-mission-planner>`.
