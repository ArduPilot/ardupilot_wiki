Mission Planner Simulation
==========================

The Simulation tab provides a SITL (Software in the Loop) simulation capability. Many typical frame types for each Vehicle type have been created. This allows you to see the expected behavior for vehicles in missions, or with a joystick attached, actually be able to fly/drive the vehicle simulation as if with RC. This allows you to see potential effects of parameter changes on vehicle behavior or explore mission generation, without risking your vehicle first.
