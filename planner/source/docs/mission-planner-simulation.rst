This section of Mission Planner, invoked by the Menu item Simulation at
the top of Mission Planner, opens a window with configuration options to
set when using HIL simulation techniques.

At the moment, this is only supported on Airplanes. 
Please see :ref:`common-simulation` for instructions on
how to use it.
