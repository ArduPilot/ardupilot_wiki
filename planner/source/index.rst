--------

The Mission Planner, created by Michael Oborne, does a lot more than its
name. Here are some of the features:

-  Point-and-click waypoint/fence/rally point entry, using Google Maps/Bing/Open street
   maps/Custom WMS.
-  Select mission commands from drop-down menus
-  Download mission log files and analyze them
-  Configure autopilot settings for your vehicle
-  Interface with a PC flight simulator to create a full
   software-in-the-loop (SITL) UAV simulator.
-  Run its own SITL simulation of many frames types for all the ArduPilot vehicles.


Please use the sidebar menus for instructions and more information.
